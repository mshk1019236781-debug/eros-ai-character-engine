-- The last of four releases. 0059 created engine.llm_generations and Release
-- A made every call site write to it; 0060 (B1, v1.7.0) gave it its history
-- and its constraints while the code stopped WRITING model and usage to the
-- child tables; B2-code (v1.7.1) stopped READING them. This migration drops
-- what nothing touches any more: the same generation's model and usage now
-- live in exactly one place, reached by the join on generation_id.
--
-- Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-24-llm-generations-audit-design.md §7.4
--
--
-- PRECONDITION, symmetric to §7.0 but with no one-query check. Do not run
-- this until the build serving traffic on EVERY machine is B2-code (v1.7.1)
-- or later — the release that neither writes these columns nor READS them.
-- The evidence is an absence, so it cannot be read out of the database:
-- check `fly image show` (or your deployment's equivalent) on every
-- machine, and that eros-engine-store has no INSERT naming model or usage
-- on these tables and no FromRow struct expecting them. Run it over a build
-- that still writes them and every rollout has a window where the old
-- machines INSERT into columns that no longer exist — a user's reply
-- failing to persist. Run it over v1.7.0 — which stopped writing but still
-- hydrates ChatMessage from SELECT * — and every history read errors
-- ColumnNotFound instead: every turn, not just replays (spec §7.4).
--
-- ROLLBACK FLOOR. Once this is deployed, the oldest build that can be
-- rolled back to is B2-code (v1.7.1). v1.7.0 reads the columns through
-- SELECT * hydration; Release A and 1.6.2 additionally name them in every
-- child INSERT. None of them survive this schema.
--
-- chat_messages.filter_model SURVIVES on purpose. It is not the model of the
-- f_generation_id generation: 2,024 rows hold the regex arm's '<regex>'
-- sentinel with no f_generation_id at all, against 1 holding a real slug. It
-- is a discriminator that happens to be spelled like a model name, not a
-- redundant copy (spec §7.4).
--
-- DROP COLUMN is a catalog-only change — no table rewrite — but it takes
-- ACCESS EXCLUSIVE, so 0060's lock_timeout reasoning carries over verbatim: a
-- failed release_command is the SAFE failure, waiting behind a long
-- transaction holds chat_messages blocked where users can see it. Same
-- ordering discipline too: coldest table first, chat_messages last, one ALTER
-- per table so each takes its lock exactly once.
