Pure-domain types and rules for the [`eros-engine`](https://github.com/etherfunlab/eros-engine) AI companion engine. No I/O, no async, no database — just data structures and the logic that operates on them.

## What's in here

- `persona` — persona definitions and instance state.
- `affinity` — the six-dimensional relationship vector with its graded write pipeline and decay rules.
- `pde` — the Persona Decision Engine: rules that decide *how* a persona responds before the LLM call.
- `ghost` — proactive (unsolicited) message scheduling logic.
- `types` — shared IDs, timestamps, and enums.

## Use it

```toml
[dependencies]
eros-engine-core = "0.1"
```

This crate is the foundation for the rest of the workspace:

- [`eros-engine-store`](https://crates.io/crates/eros-engine-store) — Postgres + pgvector persistence
- [`eros-engine-llm`](https://crates.io/crates/eros-engine-llm) — OpenRouter / Voyage HTTP clients
