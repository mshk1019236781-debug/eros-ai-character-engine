# API reference

[English](api-reference.md) · [中文](api-reference.zh.md)

A live, browsable reference is at **`/docs`** on any running instance (Scalar UI generated from utoipa annotations).

This page is a hand-written summary of the endpoints worth knowing. The Scalar UI is the authoritative spec.

## Authentication

Every `/comp/*` and `/bff/v1/*` endpoint requires `Authorization: Bearer <Supabase JWT>`. The token's `alg` header selects the validator: asymmetric signatures (ES256/RS256/EdDSA) are checked against the project's JWKS, resolved from `SUPABASE_JWKS_URL` or derived from `SUPABASE_URL` — this is the default for Supabase projects since the 2025 JWT Signing Keys rollout. Legacy HS256 against a shared `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` is still accepted for deployments that have not migrated; at least one of the two sources must be configured or the server fails to boot. The `sub` claim must be a UUID; that becomes the user_id for the request.

`/healthz` and `/docs` are public.

## Public endpoints

### `GET /healthz`

Liveness. No auth.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/healthz
```

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "eros-engine",
  "version": "1.0.x",
  "timestamp": "2026-05-05T19:06:05.309302232+00:00"
}
```

`version` is the running build's crate version (compiled in from `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`), so it tracks the deployed release.

## Chat lifecycle

### `POST /comp/chat/start`

Open a new chat session against a persona genome. The server creates a `persona_instance` for `(genome_id, jwt_user_id)` if it doesn't already exist, then a `chat_session` referencing that instance.

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"genome_id":"11d6a45a-1fd9-4fe6-a943-3f049035eb68"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/comp/chat/start
```

```json
{
  "session_id": "5f7e…",
  "instance_id": "…",
  "persona_name": "Aria",
  "is_new": true
}
```

`is_new=false` if you call `/start` again with the same `genome_id` for the same user — the engine resumes the existing session rather than creating a duplicate.

Optional `channel` field: `"text"` (default) or `"voice"`. Start/resume is
channel-scoped — a voice-channel start never resumes a text session (and
vice versa). Voice clients must obtain their session here with
`"channel": "voice"` before calling the voice turn endpoint.

Optional `force_new` field: when `true`, skip resume entirely and always
create a fresh session (`is_new: true`), even if a resumable one exists for
this user × instance × channel. Default `false`/omitted keeps the normal
resume-or-create behavior. Recommended for voice calls — start every call
with `{"channel": "voice", "force_new": true}` so each call gets its own
session instead of continuing a previous one. `POST /comp/chat/start` has no
built-in rate limit, so deployments that expose `force_new` may want
request-level rate limiting downstream.

Optional `instance_id` field: an explicit `persona_instance` id. When absent,
the server picks (or auto-creates) the user's instance for the supplied
`genome_id`; `genome_id` is required only when `instance_id` is absent.

Optional `is_demo` field: marks the new session as a demo. Persisted to the
session's `metadata.is_demo` and read by the affinity pipeline to multiply
positive judge scores by `AFFINITY_DEMO_BOOST` (default `1.4`), so meters
move visibly within a demo's turn budget. Ignored when resuming an existing
session.

### `POST /comp/chat/{session_id}/message/stream`

Streaming chat turn. Returns `text/event-stream` with the
`meta → delta* → done → final` state machine described in the
[SSE streaming chat 0.2 design spec](superpowers/specs/2026-05-19-sse-streaming-chat-0.2-design.md).

The body **must** include `client_msg_id` (26..36 ASCII-printable chars,
any UUID or ULID). Replays of the same `(session_id, client_msg_id)` within
24 h reconstruct the original frames from the database without re-calling
OpenRouter.

```bash
curl -N -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"content":"hi","client_msg_id":"01J3333333333333333333333A"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/comp/chat/<session_id>/message/stream
```

Sample frames (one JSON object per `data:` line):

```text
data: {"type":"meta","message_id":"01J...","action_type":"reply","model":"x-ai/grok-4-fast"}

data: {"type":"delta","message_id":"01J...","content":"你好"}

data: {"type":"done","message_id":"01J...","truncated":false,"usage":{"prompt_tokens":12,"completion_tokens":4,"total_tokens":16},"generation_id":"gen-abc"}

data: {"type":"final","filtered":false,"prompt_injected":null,"tier":null,"retries_chat":0,"retries_filter":0}
```

The generation is detached from the connection: if the client disconnects mid-turn, the reply still completes and persists to history (pick it up via history or Supabase Realtime), and a turn that fails after disconnect leaves a `system_error` row. Stream turns are recorded in the same queue table as the async endpoint (single attempt, no background retry).

Frame fields worth noting:

- **`meta`** — `message_id`, `action_type`, `model` (the served model id; may be omitted), and `continues_from` (optional — the previous message id when this turn continues a retry chain). `action_type` is one of `reply` | `ghost` | `reply_image` | `reply_text_image` | `product_qa` (a plain-text reply is reported as `reply`, not `reply_text` — there is no `reply_text` on the wire). `product_qa` marks an out-of-character product answer routed by the PDE judge (see [model-config.md](model-config.md)); it is excluded from companion context/memory but reported the same way on both the live stream and replay. Clients must tolerate unknown `action_type` values (new ones may be added without a major-version bump).
- **`done`** — `truncated`, `usage` (after `OPENROUTER_USAGE_HIDDEN_KEYS` filtering; always present — `null` when not applicable), `generation_id` (OpenRouter id; always present — `null` when not applicable), and `ghost_fallback` (bool; omitted when `false`). `ghost_fallback: true` marks a reply that resolved empty and was delivered as a silent fallback — this is **not** an `action_type=ghost` turn, and it leaves the ghost counters untouched. The cause is recorded on the persisted row's `metadata.fallback_reason`. A turn that promises a photo (`action_type=reply_text_image`) is exempt: an empty text half is an image-only reply, not silence, so it reports `ghost_fallback: false`, carries no `fallback_reason`, and the trailing `image_request` still fires.
- **`final`** — turn summary: `filtered` (bool — was the reply output-filtered), `prompt_injected` (array of the trait tags that injected this turn, or `null`), `tier` (echo of the request `tier`, or `null`), `retries_chat` (zero-based index of the chat attempt that succeeded), `retries_filter` (index of the filter-model attempt that served), and — since v1.4.0 — `llm_attempts` / `gateway_errors` (both **omitted when empty**; see below). No profile/lead signal rides this frame — `lead_score`, `should_show_cta`, and `agent_training_level` were removed (companion_insights teardown, spec 2026-08-11); read profile state from `GET /comp/user/{user_id}/profile` instead.

**`final.llm_attempts` / `final.gateway_errors` — the non-fatal failure
channel.** Every LLM attempt that failed this turn, across the five chains
whose failure changes what you received: the chat model chain, the input
filter, the output filter, the PDE judge, and the image prompt composer. Both
keys are omitted entirely when there were none, so a clean turn is byte-identical
to what you receive today. The element shapes are documented in
[llm-audit.md](llm-audit.md#failed-attempts-llm_attempts--gateway_errors) — the
frame serialises the identical structures the audit columns hold.

```text
data: {"type":"final","filtered":false,"prompt_injected":null,"tier":null,"retries_chat":1,"retries_filter":0,"llm_attempts":[{"task":"chat_companion","model":"x-ai/grok-4.20","http_status":529,"provider_code":"529","message":"code=529: Overloaded"}]}
```

> **Do not render these as an error.** A turn carrying them may have been served
> perfectly normally — the example above is a turn whose primary model returned
> `529` and whose fallback answered, which the user experienced as an ordinary
> reply. They exist so a consumer can alert and account without the reader
> seeing anything.

Three cases carry them: a **recovered** turn (a later hop served — the reply is
real and complete); a **pseudo-ghost** turn (the whole chain exhausted and a
canned phrase was served as a normal reply, `metadata.fallback_reason =
"stream_failure"` on the persisted row — to the end user this looks like an
ordinary short reply, and this frame is the only signal that it is not); and a
**garble-repaired** turn (`metadata.fallback_reason = "garble_repaired"`, the
reply salvaged from a garbled hop). `chat_vision` and affinity-eval failures
never ride this frame by design — both are fail-open and land in their own audit
tables. A **replayed** turn emits `final` with both lists empty, the same way it
recomputes `retries_chat` / `tier` / `prompt_injected` rather than reading them
off the row; query `engine.chat_messages` for a replayed turn's failures.

Concurrent active streams per user are capped at 3. The keep-alive heartbeat
(`: ping`) is emitted every 15 s so reverse-proxies don't time out the
idle connection.

Pre-stream errors (HTTP 4xx/5xx before the first SSE byte) carry a JSON
body with `code`, `message`, `user_message` and — for
`409 duplicate_in_progress` / `409 duplicate_failed` — an
`original_user_message_id`. `duplicate_in_progress` means the same
`(session_id, client_msg_id)` is still generating (back off and re-POST);
`duplicate_failed` means that turn terminally failed and a same-id retry can
never succeed — send a fresh `client_msg_id`. See the
[spec](superpowers/specs/2026-05-19-sse-streaming-chat-0.2-design.md#13-pre-stream-errors-http-status-json-body)
for the full code table.

**This endpoint is text-channel only.** A `session_id` belonging to a
voice-channel session is rejected with `409 wrong_channel` before any row is
persisted — it writes text-channel messages, and letting them land in a voice
conversation would interleave both channels in one transcript. Voice turns go
to [`POST /comp/voice/{session_id}/turn/stream`](#post-compvoicesession_idturnstream)
instead. The gate mirrors the voice endpoint's, so the two channels are
symmetric: neither endpoint will write into the other's sessions.

Once the first SSE byte has been written, terminal failures arrive as an
in-band `error` frame and the stream closes; the HTTP response has already
committed `200 OK`.

**`error` frame fields.** `code`, `retryable`, `message`, `user_message`, plus —
since v1.4.0 — `upstream_status` and `provider_code`, both omitted when absent.

```text
data: {"type":"error","code":"rate_limited","retryable":true,"message":"…","user_message":"…","upstream_status":429,"provider_code":"429"}
```

`upstream_status` is the provider's own HTTP status, verbatim, and appears only
when the provider actually answered. A gateway-layer failure (timeout, transport
drop, decode failure) has no status the provider returned, so both fields are
absent there. `provider_code` is the provider's own error code when its body
carried one.

`code` is derived from the failure rather than hardcoded, which brings two values
alive that were declared and **never constructed** before v1.4.0:

| Failure | `code` |
|---|---|
| Provider answered `429` | `rate_limited` **(new)** |
| Provider answered any other status | `upstream_unavailable` |
| Gateway `open_timeout` / `total_timeout` / `idle_timeout` | `timeout` **(new)** |
| Gateway `config` (local misconfiguration) | `internal` |
| Gateway `transport` / `decode` / `chain_exhausted` | `upstream_unavailable` |
| Whole-turn generation budget exceeded (`CHAT_QUEUE_GEN_TIMEOUT_SECS`) | `generation_timeout` **(new)** |

Add arms for `rate_limited`, `timeout`, and `generation_timeout`; all three
carry `retryable: true`, so a default arm that reports a permanent failure is
now wrong. `generation_timeout` is distinct from `timeout`: `timeout` is a
single upstream call's own gateway-level deadline, while `generation_timeout`
is the detached stream task's whole-turn wall-clock budget expiring — it can
fire even when every individual upstream call so far succeeded, just
cumulatively too slowly.

**Optional: tier selection.** The body may include a `tier` string —
type `String`, regex `^[a-z0-9_]{1,32}$` (returns `400` if malformed).
Selects the per-tier model and `allow_traits` from `model_config.toml`
(`[tasks.chat_companion.tiers.<tier>]`). An unknown or absent tier falls
back to the task default block (a warn is logged). Example:

```bash
curl -N -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
        "content": "hi",
        "client_msg_id": "01J3333333333333333333333A",
        "tier": "gold"
      }' \
  http://localhost:8080/comp/chat/<session_id>/message/stream
```

**Optional: per-request prompt traits.** The body may include a
`prompt_traits` array — see [prompt-traits.md](prompt-traits.md). Example:

```bash
curl -N -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
        "content": "hi",
        "client_msg_id": "01J3333333333333333333333A",
        "prompt_traits": [
          {"tag": "nsfw_boost", "text": "<your injection text here>"}
        ]
      }' \
  http://localhost:8080/comp/chat/<session_id>/message/stream
```

Limits: ≤ 8 entries, `tag` matches `[a-z0-9_]{1,32}`, `text` ≤ 2000 chars
(non-blank). Violations return `400 BadRequest` as a pre-stream error.

**Optional: memory injection scope.** The body may include a `memory_scope`
string to control which memory layers are injected into the prompt. Accepted
values:

| Value | Injected |
|-------|----------|
| `full` | Full user profile (including intimate fields) + relationship memory |
| `neutral_and_relationship` | Neutral profile (city/occupation/MBTI only) + relationship memory **(default)** |
| `relationship_only` | Relationship memory only; no profile |
| `neutral_only` | Neutral profile only; no relationship memory |
| `insights_only` | Full user profile only (intimate fields included); no relationship memory |
| `none` | No memory injection |

> **Important (#40 mitigation):** The default `neutral_and_relationship` is
> intentionally narrower than the pre-#40 behavior (which injected everything).
> Omitting `memory_scope` is **not** equivalent to the old behavior — it
> applies the narrowed default. Use `full` explicitly if you need the
> full-injection behavior.

**Optional: affinity injection scope.** The body may include an
`affinity_scope` value to control which of the six affinity axes are injected
into the prompt. Accepted values:

- Named presets: `"bond"` **(default)** — warmth + intimacy + tension;
  `"chemistry"` — trust + intrigue + patience; `"bond_and_chemistry"` / `"full"` — all six axes; `"none"` — no affinity injection.
- Axis array: any subset of `["warmth", "trust", "intrigue", "intimacy", "patience", "tension"]`.

> **Important (#40 mitigation):** The default `bond` (3 axes) is intentionally
> narrower than the pre-#40 behavior (which injected all six axes). Omitting
> `affinity_scope` is **not** equivalent to the old behavior. Use
> `"bond_and_chemistry"` or `"full"` explicitly if you need all axes.

> **Since 1.3.0 the field is injection-only again.** The 3.1 write-side
> steering (1.2.1) is retired: `affinity_scope` gates prompt injection and
> `length_score` and has no effect on scoring. See
> [Affinity model → Scope steering: retired](affinity-model.md#scope-steering-retired).

Example using both fields:

```bash
curl -N -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
        "content": "hi",
        "client_msg_id": "01J3333333333333333333333A",
        "memory_scope": "full",
        "affinity_scope": "bond_and_chemistry"
      }' \
  http://localhost:8080/comp/chat/<session_id>/message/stream
```

**Optional: quote.** The body may include `reply_to_message_id` — the UUID of a
`chat_messages` row in this session that this turn replies to. When it
resolves, the quoted line is rendered into the reply prompt as a `[quote]`
block (its text, whether the persona or the user said it, and how long ago),
and the anchor is recorded on the persisted user row's
`metadata.reply_to_message_id`, from which both history routes echo it back.

**A quote points at one line; it does not rewind the conversation.** The
history window is the same newest-N with or without it, so quoting something
from last week costs the model nothing that was said since. A
present-but-unresolvable id (unknown, or belonging to another session) does not
fail the request and does not change the context either: the turn simply runs
without a `[quote]` block, and the row's `metadata.reply_to_error` is set to
`"not_found"`.

```bash
curl -N -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
        "content": "wait, about that earlier plan",
        "client_msg_id": "01J3333333333333333333333A",
        "reply_to_message_id": "3cc06c53-9d2e-4f8a-b3c1-0a1b2c3d4e5f"
      }' \
  http://localhost:8080/comp/chat/<session_id>/message/stream
```

**Optional: OpenRouter audit passthrough.** The body may include an
`audit` object that rides directly to OpenRouter as wire-level `user` /
`session_id` / `metadata` — see [llm-audit.md](llm-audit.md). Example:

```bash
curl -N -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
        "content": "hi",
        "client_msg_id": "01J3333333333333333333333A",
        "audit": {
          "user": "u_<hash>",
          "session_id": "conv_xyz",
          "metadata": { "feature": "chat", "plan": "pro" }
        }
      }' \
  http://localhost:8080/comp/chat/<session_id>/message/stream
```

Caps: `audit.user` and `audit.session_id` ≤ 256 chars; `audit.metadata`
≤ 16 keys, key matches `[A-Za-z0-9_.-]{1,64}`, value is a string ≤ 512
chars. Violations return `400 BadRequest` as a pre-stream error.

**Optional: tip.** The body may include `tips_amount_usd` (a finite number,
`> 0` and `≤ 1_000_000`) to mark this turn as a tip. The turn is persisted with
`role = gift_user`: if `content` is empty the stored content becomes
`(打赏 $<amount>)`, otherwise your `content` is kept. The tip amount rides to the
model so the persona can react in its reply, and it is echoed back on the BFF
history row (`tips_amount_usd`). A tip and an image cannot be sent on the same
turn. Replaces the old `POST /comp/chat/{session_id}/event/gift` route, which has
been removed.

```bash
curl -N -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
        "content": "",
        "client_msg_id": "01J3333333333333333333333A",
        "tips_amount_usd": 9.99
      }' \
  http://localhost:8080/comp/chat/<session_id>/message/stream
```

**Optional: image input (vision).** The body may include `image_url` — an
absolute `http(s)` URL with a host, no embedded whitespace, ≤ 2048 chars. When
present, the engine runs a vision *describe* pre-stage (the `chat_vision` task)
and feeds the description into the reply. `image_url` and `tips_amount_usd` are
mutually exclusive on a single turn. A malformed URL returns `422 Unprocessable
Entity` (`code: "unprocessable"`) as a pre-stream error. Vision is active only
if `[tasks.chat_vision]` is configured with a non-blank `filter_prompt` (see
[model-config.md](model-config.md)).

```bash
curl -N -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
        "content": "what is in this picture?",
        "client_msg_id": "01J3333333333333333333333A",
        "image_url": "https://example.com/cat.jpg"
      }' \
  http://localhost:8080/comp/chat/<session_id>/message/stream
```

**Optional: companion image reply.** The body may include an `image` object —
`ImageReplyParams` — to request or force a companion-generated image this turn.
The `image` block is also the per-turn opt-in: **omit it to suppress image
generation for the turn** (the PDE may then only `reply_text` / `ghost`), or
send `image: {}` to enable it with the engine's built-in defaults. This lets a caller's own
per-turn policy gate images independently of the PDE's content decision.

```bash
curl -N -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
        "content": "give me a smile",
        "client_msg_id": "01J3333333333333333333333A",
        "image": {
          "force": true,
          "style": "realistic",
          "aspect_ratio": "3:4"
        }
      }' \
  http://localhost:8080/comp/chat/<session_id>/message/stream
```

An `image` block signals the consumer handles image drawing this turn; the
engine composes the prompt and emits a single `image_request` frame (it never
draws on the chat stream).

`ImageReplyParams` fields (all optional):

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `force` | `bool` | `false` | Override the PDE decision for this turn — the turn is always `reply_image` (image only, no text reply). Requires `[tasks.chat_image_prompt_compose]` to be configured (`422` otherwise), and `content` follows the ordinary non-empty rule. When `false` the PDE decides. A leftover `mode` key from the pre-1.0.1 contract deserializes and is silently ignored. |
| `style` | `"realistic"` \| `"semi_realistic"` \| `"anime"` | `"realistic"` | One of the three engine-owned style presets; `"realistic"` is the engine's built-in default. |
| `aspect_ratio` | `String` | none | Allowed: `1:1`, `3:4`, `4:3`, `9:16`, `16:9`; absent when omitted (PDE plan → request → absent). Returns `422` if invalid. |
| `prompt_variant` | `String` | none | Selects a `[tasks.chat_image_prompt_compose].filter_prompt` variant: an index (`"0"`, `"1"`) or a key (`"a"`, `"b"`), depending on how that task is configured (see [model-config.md](model-config.md)). `"raw"` carries no special meaning: it selects a prompt only if the deployment configures a variant under that literal key, exactly like any other name. An index/key that doesn't match — `"raw"` included — falls back to the engine's built-in composer prompt, never a `422` or other error. Ignored when the task isn't configured, or configures a single plain prompt. |

**Reference selection (`image_ref`).** The PDE verdict carries `image_ref`
(`"face"` | `"previous"`, default `"face"`) and rides on the `image_request`
frame (below) — the chat stream never resolves it to a URL itself. The
`previous`-with-no-image → `face` fallback, and the `face_ref_url` /
`prev_image_url` reference URLs, belong to the consumer's own image-vendor
call (the engine has no draw endpoint). The persisted `metadata.image` marker
records the composer's picture subject, the aspect ratio, and its `caption`
(the short line the composer returned alongside the prompt, or `None` when it
gave none — the chat history and the judge transcript read back only the
caption, never the long prompt), plus — only when the composer LLM call
succeeded — the audit trio `compose_variant` (the `filter_prompt` key/index
that was selected, absent for a plain or built-in prompt), `compose_model`,
and `compose_generation_id`. Absence of the trio means the turn had no
successful compose (fail-open degradation, or composer not configured). A
`compose_event_id` pointer is present whenever the audit write itself
succeeded — independent of whether the compose call did — and is the
reachable link to `engine.chat_images_events`, where the composed **wire**
prompt actually lives (the `metadata.image` marker never duplicates it); see
[LLM audit → Image-path event tables](llm-audit.md#image-path-event-tables).
The marker also records `image_ref` (`"face"` | `"previous"`), so the full
`image_request` payload stays recoverable after the fact (absent on rows
persisted before it was added).

Validation: `force` + `tips_amount_usd` on the same turn → `422`. `force`
while `[tasks.chat_image_prompt_compose]` is not configured → `422` (the
composer is the only prompt source; without it a forced image could only be a
generic portrait). An unsupported `aspect_ratio` returns `422 Unprocessable
Entity` (`code: "unprocessable"`) as a pre-stream error. All are pre-stream:
no user row is persisted.

**`image_request` SSE frame** — emitted once per image turn in place of any
in-engine draw. The engine composes the prompt; the consumer draws it via its
own image vendor (there is no engine draw endpoint). The chat stream itself
draws nothing, streams no image bytes, and persists no draw result.

| Field | Type | Notes |

| `type` | `"image_request"` | Frame type discriminator. |
| `message_id` | `String` | The real assistant `message_id`; key the draw and storage to it. |
| `composed_prompt` | `String` | base64(`STANDARD`, unwrapped) of the UTF-8 final wire prompt. Decode at the last hop and use verbatim as the provider text prompt — reconstruct no prompt logic. |
| `image_ref` | `"face"` \| `"previous"` | Which reference image the plan chose; the consumer resolves the actual URL. |
| `aspect_ratio` | `String` \| absent | The semantic aspect (`1:1`,`3:4`,`4:3`,`9:16`,`16:9`) or absent. The consumer owns aspect→resolution mapping; no width/height is sent. |

**Full SSE frame sequences:**

- image-only: `meta(reply_image) → done → image_request → final`
- text + image: `meta(reply_text_image) → delta* → done → image_request → final`
- `ghost`: `meta(action_type=ghost) → done → final` — no `delta`, no `model` in `meta`, `usage` and `generation_id` are `null` in `done`. The companion stayed silent this turn; no LLM was called.
- `product_qa`: `meta(action_type=product_qa) → delta* → done → final` — same shape as a normal text reply, streamed by an independent model chain (`[tasks.chat_product_qa]`) instead of `chat_companion`; persisted with `channel='product_qa'` and reported as `product_qa` again on replay.

The engine never draws and no draw-lifecycle frames exist: the consumer
receives `image_request` and calls its own image vendor.

The frame itself is wire-only. A consumer that was not connected when it
fired — an async turn, or a stream client that disconnected mid-turn — can
recover the same payload afterwards via
[`GET /comp/chat/{session_id}/messages/{message_id}/image-request`](#get-compchatsession_idmessagesmessage_idimage-request):
an image turn is recognizable in history by `metadata.image` on the
assistant row.

### `POST /v2/comp/session/{session_id}/message/async`

Enqueue-only chat turn — the async alternative to the stream endpoint above,
for callers that cannot hold an SSE connection open (bot gateways, background
senders). Same body (`StreamSendRequest`) and the same validation and
auth/ownership/`wrong_channel` checks as `message/stream` (`client_msg_id` is
required on both), and no reply is ever returned here: a background worker
drives the same generation pipeline and the reply lands in
`engine.chat_messages`, picked up via the history route or Supabase
Realtime.

The pre-rename path `POST /v2/comp/chat/{session_id}/message/async` was removed in 1.6.0 and now 404s (for an authenticated request; `require_auth` still 401s first) — see [`docs/migrating/v1-6-0-async-chat.md`](migrating/v1-6-0-async-chat.md).

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content":"hi","client_msg_id":"01J3333333333333333333333A"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/v2/comp/session/<session_id>/message/async
```

| Case | Response |
|---|---|
| New message enqueued | `202 {"status":"queued","user_message_id":...}` |
| Redelivery of a still-pending/claimed `client_msg_id` | `202 {"status":"already_queued",...}` |
| Redelivery of an already-processed `client_msg_id` | `200 {"status":"already_completed",...}` |
| Redelivery of a terminally failed `client_msg_id` | `200 {"status":"failed",...}` — retry with a fresh `client_msg_id` |
| Per-session pending depth over `CHAT_QUEUE_PENDING_CAP` | `429 rate_limited` |
| Other pre-stream failures | same `StreamPreError` shape and codes as `message/stream` above |

Queue order is strict per-session LIFO — the newest pending message in a
session is processed first — and every enqueued message eventually gets a
turn; nothing is coalesced or dropped, only reordered. Worker config

### `POST /v2/comp/session/{session_id}/message/{message_id}/image/edit`

Revise a picture the character already sent. `{message_id}` is an image turn —
a message whose history entry carries `"image": true`. The engine composes a new
image prompt from that picture's subject plus the instruction, persists a new
image-only assistant message, and returns its `image_request` payload; the
consumer draws it, exactly as for a chat image turn.

```json
{
  "instruction": "换套衣服",
  "style": "realistic",
  "aspect_ratio": "3:4",
  "prompt_variant": "a",
  "persist_instruction": true,
  "evaluate_affinity": true,
  "reply_with_text": 0.4
}
```

- `instruction` — required, non-blank, ≤4096 chars. What to change, in the
  user's words. Without `persist_instruction` it is an input to a picture, not
  a chat message: recorded on the audit row and never persisted as
  conversation.
- `style` — `realistic` (default) | `semi_realistic` | `anime`. Pass the style
  the source was drawn with; the engine does not record it on the message.
- `aspect_ratio` — `1:1` | `3:4` | `4:3` | `9:16` | `16:9`. Defaults to the
  source turn's.
- `prompt_variant` — selects a `[tasks.chat_image_edit_compose].filter_prompt`
  variant, with the same rules as the chat path's `image.prompt_variant`.
- `persist_instruction` — default `false`. When set, the instruction is
  persisted as an ordinary `role='user'` message quoting the source turn
  (`metadata.reply_to_message_id`, the same key the chat path writes), and the
  new image row hangs off it instead of inheriting the source's turn. History
  then replays the exchange: user instruction → assistant picture. The row is
  a real user message — visible to companion context, memory extraction and
  later affinity evaluation like anything else the user said.
- `evaluate_affinity` — default `false`. When set, the turn goes through the
  standard per-turn affinity judge: the instruction is what the user said, the
  new picture's caption is what the character answered. Detached — the response
  never waits on the judge. Orthogonal to `persist_instruction` (the judge
  reads the instruction either way); when an instruction row was persisted it
  anchors the affinity event's `user_message_id`. Overridden by
  `reply_with_text` — the full pipeline it starts already includes the judge.
- `reply_with_text` — absent by default; `0.0`–`1.0`, else 422. Requires
  `persist_instruction` (silently inert without it). When present, the edit is
  a **full chat turn**: the whole post-turn pipeline runs afterward — affinity,
  memory, insights, exactly as after a chat turn — and the value is the
  probability that the character also says something with the picture. `0`
  never (`reply_image` every time), `1` always (`reply_text_image` every
  time), in between the engine rolls — the dice stand in for the PDE, which
  this endpoint never consults. The text half is a real companion-model reply
  driven by the persisted instruction row (history, memory recall and
  relationship context included) and lands in the same assistant row as the
  picture, chat-shaped. A failed or blank text half degrades the turn to
  `reply_image` — the picture is the turn's substance — and the row's failure
  columns keep the evidence.

```json
{
  "message_id": "…",
  "edit_of": "…",
  "composed_prompt": "<base64>",
  "image_ref": "previous",
  "aspect_ratio": "3:4",
  "caption": "换了条裙子",
  "instruction_message_id": "…",
  "action_type": "reply_text_image",
  "reply_text": "新造型来啦，你看看喜欢吗"
}
```

`instruction_message_id` is present only when `persist_instruction` was set:
the persisted instruction message, so a client can render the user bubble
without refetching history.

`action_type` says what the turn is: `reply_text_image` when the
`reply_with_text` dice rolled a text half and it landed, `reply_image`
otherwise — including every call without `reply_with_text`. `reply_text` is
present exactly on `reply_text_image` turns.

`composed_prompt` is base64(STANDARD) of the UTF-8 wire prompt — the same
encoding as the SSE `image_request` frame and the recovery endpoint, so an
existing draw path consumes it unchanged. `image_ref` is always `previous`, and
on an edit turn that means **the `edit_of` picture**, not whatever the consumer
drew last.

The new message is an ordinary image turn: it appears in history with
`"image": true` and its prompt is recoverable via
`GET /comp/chat/{session_id}/messages/{message_id}/image-request`. Its
`metadata.image` additionally carries `edit_of`. An edit can itself be edited.

Nothing else about a turn runs on this call by default: no PDE decision, no
affinity movement, no insight or memory extraction. Two opt-ins widen that:
`evaluate_affinity` runs the affinity pass alone, nothing else; and
`reply_with_text` turns the whole call into a full chat turn (see above).
Without `persist_instruction` the
new row inherits the source's `user_message_id` — the edit belongs to the turn
the original picture answered; with it, the new row's `user_message_id` is the
persisted instruction message.

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 401 | missing or invalid bearer |
| 403 | not your session |
| 404 | unknown session, or no such message in it |
| **409** | the message exists but is not an image turn |
| 422 | blank `instruction`, or unsupported `aspect_ratio` |
| 501 | neither `[tasks.chat_image_edit_compose]` nor `[tasks.chat_image_prompt_compose]` is configured |
| 429 | per-user in-flight cap reached (3, shared with chat/voice/compose) |
| 5XX | composer chain exhausted — the provider's own status and body, as on the compose endpoint. **No message is persisted**; retry is safe |

A body that fails to deserialize (missing `instruction`, wrong type for
`style`) or a malformed path UUID is rejected by axum's extractors before any
of the above, with a framework-shaped plain-text 400/422 — not the
`{"error", "message"}` shape this endpoint returns. The 422 cases in the table
above (blank `instruction`, unsupported `aspect_ratio`) are ones the request
deserialized successfully into, gated after ownership and state as described.

Requires `[tasks.chat_image_edit_compose]` **or** `[tasks.chat_image_prompt_compose]`:
with only the latter, edits run on the chat composer's chain using the engine's
built-in edit prompt.

### `GET /comp/chat/{session_id}/history?limit=20&offset=0`

Paginated message history, newest first. `limit` defaults to 20 (capped at 50).

```json
{
  "session_id": "…",
  "messages": [
    { "id": "…", "role": "assistant", "content": "Bishop.", "sent_at": "…", "read_at": "…" },
    { "id": "…", "role": "user",      "content": "hi…",     "sent_at": "…", "read_at": "…" },
    { "id": "…", "role": "assistant", "content": "…", "sent_at": "…", "channel": "product_qa" },
    { "id": "…", "role": "assistant", "content": "",  "sent_at": "…", "image": true }
  ],
  "total": 4
}
```

`id` is the stable message id (the `engine.chat_messages` row key) — it is
what the `image-request` route below takes. `role` ∈
`user | assistant | gift_user | system_error`. `gift_user` is a tip
turn (sent via `tips_amount_usd` on the stream route, above). Each entry also
carries an optional `channel` field — `"product_qa"` marks an
out-of-character product answer (excluded from companion context/memory,
same as its live-stream `action_type`); the field is omitted for normal
turns. `read_at` is a read receipt and is **omitted entirely while unread** —
see the route below.

`image: true` is present only on assistant rows whose turn delegated an image
to the consumer; every other row omits the key (never `false`). It is the
discovery half of the `image-request` route: feed the flagged entry's `id` to
that route instead of probing every assistant message. A `404` from that
route **on a flagged row** means the composed prompt was never recorded —
genuinely unrecoverable; surface it as such rather than silently dropping
the image. The flag also tells a rehydrating client that a turn promised an
image (the `image_request` SSE frame is the turn's last frame and wire-only —
a disconnect before it fires would otherwise be undetectable from history).

`reply_to_message_id` echoes the quote a `user` row was sent with (see
**Optional: quote** above): the id of the row it quoted, always in this same
session.

`user_message_id` names the `role='user'` row whose turn produced this row. It
is present on assistant rows and on `system_error` notices, and omitted on the
user rows themselves. The notices matter most: the queue worker and the
stale-claim reaper write them after the client has already disconnected, so
history is the only place a client can find them — and a notice is useless
without knowing which turn failed. Do not assume the newest user row is the one. Same key-presence contract — omitted on ordinary turns,
and omitted when the anchor failed to resolve, since there is no bubble to
point at. That failure is recorded as `metadata.reply_to_error` on the row and
stays audit-only; a client that needs to know its quote was dropped should read
the SSE turn it sent, not history.

### `GET /comp/chat/{session_id}/messages/{message_id}/image-request`

The delegated `image_request` payload for one persisted image turn — the
recovery path for consumers that never received the SSE frame (async turns;
stream clients that disconnected before the frame fired). Auth and session
ownership checks are the same as `history`.

```json
{ "message_id": "01J…", "composed_prompt": "5YaZ5a6e…", "image_ref": "previous", "aspect_ratio": "3:4" }
```

Fields mirror the SSE frame: `composed_prompt` is base64(`STANDARD`) of the
UTF-8 wire prompt; `image_ref` may be absent on rows persisted before the
marker carried it. **Absent `image_ref` means unknown, not `face`** — a
consumer that defaults it to `face` will redraw a `previous`-ref turn against
the wrong reference image. `404` when the message is not an image turn — or when the
turn's compose event was never recorded (the audit write is fail-open); in
that case the prompt is genuinely unrecoverable and the consumer should
treat the turn as text-only.

### `POST /comp/chat/{session_id}/read`

Mark every message in the session the user did not author as read. Same auth,
ownership check and 404-on-archived behaviour as the history route above.

```json
{
  "session_id": "8a1f0c2e-4b6d-4f8a-9c31-2d5e7f0a1b3c",
  "marked": 7
}
```

Write-only: the engine records a timestamp and stops there. It does not count
unread messages, does not notify, and does not decide what "read" looks like —
a client reads `read_at` off the history entries and renders whatever it wants.

`marked` counts the rows *this* call stamped, so a repeat call returns `200`
with `0` and an existing stamp is never pushed forward. Call it on every mount
without inventing an event.

Two roles are out of reach here, and they are the two the user writes. A `user`
row carries the engine's own stamp — set the instant the turn handed the message
to its first model, which is the *delivered* tick and not that model's
acknowledgement; a `gift_user` tip is never stamped by anyone, because nobody
reads a tip on the user's behalf.

Voice sessions are accepted, and their `assistant` rows are stamped like any
other — only the engine's own writer is text-only, so it is voice **`user`**
rows that stay unstamped.

**Read `read_at: absent` as "no receipt", never as "not yet read."** Tips, voice
`user` rows, and — on a deployment running without the PDE judge — every `user`
row stay unstamped permanently.

See [2026-08-19-chat-message-read-at-design.md](superpowers/specs/2026-08-19-chat-message-read-at-design.md).

## Voice

### `POST /comp/voice/{session_id}/turn/stream`

Lean voice-channel turn: one transcribed user utterance in, one streamed
text reply out. STT and TTS are entirely the caller's job — the engine
never touches audio (see the
[voice-call parts design spec](superpowers/specs/2026-07-07-voice-call-parts-design.md)).

Returns `text/event-stream` with a reduced frame set: `delta`* then a
terminal `done`, or a single `error` — the same frame shapes as the chat
message stream above, but with **no** `meta` frame and no `action_type`.

The session must be a **voice-channel** session (`409 wrong_channel`
otherwise) — obtain one via `POST /comp/chat/start` with
`"channel": "voice"`. Voice is opt-in per deployment: without a
`[tasks.chat_voice]` block in the model config the endpoint returns
`501 voice_disabled`.

The prompt is lean but not memoryless: persona + voice directive + a
first-turn **bootstrap snapshot** (frozen once per session, then re-injected
verbatim every turn) + one relationship line derived from the session's
affinity (bond/chemistry tiers) + this turn's **recall block**. History is
the last 8 messages (4 exchanges) — shorter than the chat path's window,
since the bootstrap and recall carry the longer-range memory instead. A
voice **turn** writes no memories (no insight extraction, no vector
writes), but a finished **call** does: once the session goes idle, the
dreaming-lite sweeper distills its transcript into profile-layer memories,
so later calls and text chats can recall it. Operators opt out with
`DREAMING_VOICE_DISABLED=1` — see
[memory-layers.md](memory-layers.md#voice-turns).

**Bootstrap snapshot** (first turn only, then frozen into
`chat_sessions.metadata.voice_bootstrap` and replayed on every later turn —
the provider is stateless, so there is no "inject once" on the wire): a
`[关于他]` block of `human_insights` bullets (Neutral tier by default; see
`memory_scope` below) plus a `[上次通话]` block, the previous voice call's
last 8 messages rendered as a transcript. The two parts degrade
independently and silently — a failed assembly leaves the marker unwritten
so the next turn retries.

**Per-turn recall** (every turn, read-only): a small vector-search pass over
the same `companion_memories` layers the chat path uses, gated by
`memory_scope` and budgeted at 300 ms — a timeout or search failure just
drops the block for that turn, never an error. An utterance under 4
alphanumeric characters after stripping whitespace/punctuation (嗯 / 好啊 /
哈哈-style backchannels) skips recall entirely, with no embedding call.
Deployments can force recall off regardless of the request via
`[tasks.chat_voice] recall = false` (default `true` — see
[model-config.md](model-config.md)).

Body fields:

- `content` — the user utterance. Max 4096 chars.
- `client_msg_id` — 26..36 ASCII-printable chars (any UUID or ULID).
  Replaying the same `(session_id, client_msg_id)` is a conflict **only when
  the turn already produced something**: an assistant reply already exists
  (retrying would double-bill), or the turn was deliberately interrupted (see
  [`turn/interrupt`](#post-compvoicesession_idturninterrupt) below) — either
  way returns `409 duplicate`. With neither — an abnormal disconnect, or an
  upstream failure that exhausted every candidate model — the replay
  **regenerates**: it reuses the persisted user row and issues a fresh call
  rather than erroring. On that repair path the request body's `content` is
  **ignored**; the previously persisted utterance is authoritative (a
  mismatch is only logged as a warning, never rejected), because the
  per-turn recall embeds that text as its query and must not drift between
  attempts. This also means a retry after an `Error { retryable: true }`
  frame now actually succeeds, instead of being turned away by the very
  duplicate check the client was told it could pass.
- `affinity_scope` (optional) — same field name, value space, and default
  (`"bond"`) as the
  [chat message stream](#post-compchatsession_idmessagestream): a named
  value `"full" | "bond_and_chemistry" | "bond" | "chemistry" | "none"`,
  or an array of axis names such as `["warmth", "trust"]`. Voice injects
  at half granularity, so the resolved axes flatten to the two halves of
  the relationship line: any bond axis (warmth / intimacy / tension) ⇒
  the bond half, any chemistry axis (trust / intrigue / patience) ⇒ the
  chemistry half. The audit trail: the **user** row records the raw value
  under `metadata.affinity_scope_raw` (and `metadata.memory_scope_raw`),
  each only when the request carried the field; the **assistant** row
  keeps the resolved **`metadata.affinity_scope`** — the same 6-bool
  object (`warmth` / `trust` / `intrigue` / `intimacy` / `patience` /
  `tension`), byte-identical in shape to what the
  [chat message stream](#post-compchatsession_idmessagestream) writes —
  plus the resolved `metadata.memory_scope`.
- `memory_scope` (optional) — same field name, enum, and default
  (`"neutral_and_relationship"`) as the
  [chat message stream](#post-compchatsession_idmessagestream). On the
  session's **first successfully-assembling** turn, the resolved insight
  tier picks the bootstrap snapshot's `[关于他]` tier and is frozen for the
  rest of the call; every turn it also gates that turn's recall block.
  Later turns cannot change the snapshot's tier.

```bash
curl -N -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content":"你今天在干嘛？","client_msg_id":"01JABCDEFGHJKMNPQRSTVWXYZ0","affinity_scope":"bond","memory_scope":"neutral_and_relationship"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/comp/voice/{session_id}/turn/stream
```

### `POST /comp/voice/{session_id}/turn/interrupt`

Reports a deliberate barge-in: the user started talking while the client was
still playing the companion's reply.

**This endpoint does not stop generation.** Aborting the client's SSE
connection to `turn/stream` already does that — the stream generator is
dropped at its current await point, which drops the upstream connection with
it. This endpoint's only job is to record **what was actually heard**, which
the aborted generator can no longer do itself: its persist step sits after
the streaming loop and never runs on a drop. Plain JSON in, plain JSON out —
this is not an SSE route.

**No `501 voice_disabled` gate**, unlike `turn/stream`. This endpoint makes
no LLM call, so gating it on `[tasks.chat_voice]` would make an in-flight
call's interrupt fail if the deployment's config changed mid-call.

Body:

```json
{ "client_msg_id": "01JABCDEFGHJKMNPQRSTVWXYZ0", "spoken_text": "你今天过得" }
```

- `client_msg_id` — the turn being interrupted, same 26..36 ASCII-printable
  format as `turn/stream`. It **must be the session's latest user turn** —
  see the guard below.
- `spoken_text` — what TTS actually played, verbatim. MAY be empty (the user
  cut in before any audible word); an empty string writes no assistant
  content at all — only the marker on the user row records that an interrupt
  happened. Max 4096 chars.

Response `200`:

```json
{ "message_id": "01JABCDEFGHJKMNPQRSTVWXYZ0" }
```

`message_id` is the assistant row that now holds the spoken text, or `null`
when nothing was played and no reply row exists to point at.

**Latest-turn guard.** A `client_msg_id` naming anything other than the
session's most recent user row is rejected with `409 not_latest_turn`.
Without this guard, the upsert below would let a client overwrite the
`content` of **any** past assistant reply — you can only barge in on what is
currently being spoken. This puts an ordering requirement on the client:
**send the interrupt before starting the next turn.** A late interrupt is
rejected and the turn simply degrades to the abnormal-disconnect state
(recoverable via `turn/stream`'s regeneration, described above) rather than
rewriting history.

**Upsert semantics (completion race).** The abort and the interrupt POST are
two separate round trips, so the server may not have processed the SSE
disconnect yet — `turn/stream`'s own post-stream persist can still land
concurrently. Both writers target the same assistant row (keyed on the user
row's id, `ON CONFLICT (user_message_id) WHERE role='assistant' AND
channel='voice'`), so exactly one row survives regardless of arrival order,
and its `content` always ends up as the interrupt's report:

| Assistant row | `spoken_text` | Result |
|---|---|---|
| absent | non-empty | inserted, `truncated = true` |
| absent | empty | no assistant row written |
| already exists (race) | non-empty | `content` overwritten, `truncated = true`; `generation_id` (the join key into `llm_generations`) and `affinity_scope` / `memory_scope` metadata preserved |
| already exists (race) | empty | `content` left untouched |

Repeated interrupt calls for the same turn are idempotent — the marker and
the upsert both key off the user row's id, so a retry cannot multiply rows.

**A race outside this table: two `turn/stream` generators for the same
turn**, e.g. an orphaned generator from a dead connection still alive
(TCP retransmission) when the client's retry starts its own. No interrupt is
involved, so none of the four rows above apply — there is no marker to make
one writer authoritative. That case is last-writer-wins on `content`,
`truncated`, and the audit columns together (never a mix of one generation's
text with a different generation's `generation_id`); see
`insert_voice_assistant_message` in `crates/eros-engine-store/src/chat.rs`.

Status ladder:

| Status | Code | When |
|---|---|---|
| 200 | — | interrupt recorded (see body above) |
| 400 | `invalid_payload` | `client_msg_id` outside 26..36 ASCII-printable chars |
| 401 | `unauthorized` | missing / malformed / expired / wrong-secret JWT |
| 403 | `session_forbidden` | session not owned by the JWT user |
| 404 | `session_not_found` | unknown `session_id` |
| 404 | `turn_not_found` | `client_msg_id` names no user row in this session |
| 409 | `wrong_channel` | session is not a voice-channel session |
| 409 | `not_latest_turn` | the named turn is not the session's latest user row |
| 422 | `unprocessable` | `spoken_text` longer than 4096 chars |

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"client_msg_id":"01JABCDEFGHJKMNPQRSTVWXYZ0","spoken_text":"你今天过得"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/comp/voice/{session_id}/turn/interrupt
```

## Persona

### `POST /persona/{instance_id}/image/compose`

Standalone image-prompt composition for a persona instance — a consumer that
wants a prompt for arbitrary text, not a chat turn. **No chat state is
touched — no session, no messages, no affinity runs, no memory is written.**
Every call is audited, though, with one caveat for streaming mode on client
disconnect (see below). The instance must belong to the JWT user (`403`
otherwise; `404` when it does not exist). Requires
`[tasks.chat_image_prompt_compose]` (`501 compose_disabled` without it).

The endpoint doubles as a composer test surface: the response carries `model`
and `generation_id`, and streaming passes the composer's raw output through
verbatim — the most common failure when tuning a `filter_prompt` is the model
not emitting valid JSON, and the operator needs to see what it actually
returned.

Body fields:

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `content` | `String` | yes | Non-empty after trim, max 4096 chars. Lands in the `[对方最新消息]` composer slot. |
| `scene` | `String` | no | Lands in `[最近场景]`; omitted or blank ⇒ `（无）`. Max 8192 chars (`422` over). A composer *input*, not the prompt — the engine never copies it into `composed_prompt`; only the composer's own output is assembled. |
| `style` | `String` | no | Same three presets as the chat path; default `realistic`. |
| `aspect_ratio` | `String` | no | Same allow-list as the chat path; `422` on anything else. |
| `prompt_variant` | `String` | no | Same variant selection as the chat path, including the unknown-key-falls-back-to-built-in rule. |
| `stream` | `bool` | no | Default `true`. |

The composer payload is identical to the chat path's five slots, so one
`filter_prompt` contract serves both callers (see
[model-config.md](model-config.md)).

Every call — success or failure — is recorded in `engine.chat_images_events`
(`source = "compose_endpoint"` or `"compose_endpoint_stream"`): the non-stream
mode writes synchronously before its HTTP response returns, with no gap. The
streaming mode's writes live inside the SSE generator itself, so a client
that disconnects before the generator reaches one loses that row too, even
though the call was billed. See [LLM audit → Image-path event
tables](llm-audit.md#image-path-event-tables).

Both modes return the same five fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `composed_prompt` | Style preset + persona appearance + subject — the string to hand an image vendor |
| `subject` | The composer's own prompt field, before assembly |
| `caption` | The composer's short caption, `null` when it produced none |
| `model` | The model that actually answered |
| `generation_id` | For reconciling against provider logs |

`stream: false` returns them as one JSON body. `stream: true` returns
`text/event-stream`:

```
data: {"type":"delta","content":"{\"prompt\":\"…"}
data: {"type":"done","composed_prompt":"…","subject":"…","caption":"…","model":"…","generation_id":"…"}
```

- `delta` frames carry the composer's raw output as it arrives, verbatim and
  unparsed.
- one terminal `done` frame carries the five fields — its payload minus the
  `type` discriminator is byte-identical to the `stream: false` body.
- a single `{"type":"error",…}` frame on failure after streaming has begun,
  matching the chat stream's in-band error shape (`code`, `retryable`,
  `message`, `user_message`).

There is no `meta` frame. A consumer that only wants the result ignores the
deltas and reads the terminal frame.

A successful-but-non-JSON composer reply keeps the chat path's behaviour:
`subject` is the whole raw reply, `caption` is `null`, and `composed_prompt`
is assembled from it as usual.

**Treat the output as model-generated, not sanitized.** "The engine never
copies `content` / `scene` into `composed_prompt`" is a routing property, not
a safety boundary: the composer is a language model reading caller-supplied
text, so those slots can steer it, and it can echo them back through the
`delta` frames and `subject`. The length caps bound cost, not influence. A
caller that forwards `composed_prompt` to an image vendor owns whatever policy
that vendor requires.

Failure modes:

| Condition | Response |
|---|---|
| `[tasks.chat_image_prompt_compose]` absent | `501 compose_disabled` |
| Instance not owned by the JWT user | `403` |
| Instance not found | `404` |
| Blank `content`, over-cap `scene`, bad `aspect_ratio` | `422` |
| Over the per-user in-flight cap (shared with chat/voice, ≤3) | `429` |
| Composer chain exhausted | **The provider's own status, verbatim** (see below) — or an in-band `error` frame if streaming has begun. **No portrait fallback here**: the fallback exists to keep a chat turn moving, and this endpoint has no turn to protect. |

**Status passthrough (v1.4.0).** This endpoint used to render `502` whatever the
upstream said. It now returns the provider's own status — `529`, `503`, `429`,
or anything else it sent, including a code the engine has never seen. A failure
with no status of its own (the gateway cases) is synthesised: **`504` for the
three timeout kinds, `502` for everything else.** Detect a provider failure by
the body's `"error": "upstream"` key, not by the status.

Passthrough has one bound, and it is a range rather than an allow-list: a status
**below `400` is never forwarded**. A provider that answers `200` with an error
envelope in the body has spoken, but not in the status line, and forwarding that
`200` would tell you the call succeeded. Those answer `502`. The real value is
still on `upstream_status`, which is why you branch on the body.

```jsonc
// the provider answered, with a status
{"error":"upstream","message":"upstream failure: code=529: Overloaded",
 "upstream_status":529,"provider_code":"529","error_type":"overloaded","retryable":true}

// our path to the provider broke; no upstream status exists
{"error":"upstream","message":"upstream failure: compose stream open timeout after 15s",
 "gateway_kind":"open_timeout","retryable":true}
```

`error` and `message` are unchanged. `upstream_status` / `provider_code` /
`error_type` appear on the upstream arm (the latter two only when the provider's
body carried them); `gateway_kind` appears on the gateway arm — one of
`open_timeout` | `total_timeout` | `idle_timeout` | `transport` | `decode` |
`config` | `chain_exhausted`. `retryable` is always present and derived from the
status by HTTP convention (every `5xx`, plus `408` and `429`). **`Retry-After` is
forwarded verbatim** as a response header when the provider sent one — the engine
records and passes it on, never acts on it.

The streaming mode's in-band `error` frame keeps its four fields and does **not**
gain `upstream_status` / `provider_code`: the composer chain is walked while
opening the stream, so a total failure happens before the SSE response exists and
comes back as the HTTP error above.

```bash
curl -N -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content":"在海边，黄昏","style":"realistic","aspect_ratio":"3:4","stream":false}' \
  http://localhost:8080/persona/{instance_id}/image/compose
```

## Profile

### `GET /comp/chat/{user_id}/sessions`

All chat sessions for `user_id`. The path's `user_id` MUST match the JWT's user_id; otherwise 403. Returns `{ "sessions": [...] }`, each entry carrying `session_id`, `instance_id`, `is_converted`, `last_active_at`, and `channel`.

### `GET /comp/user/{user_id}/profile`

The flat, typed `human_insights` row for this user — the same columns the insight extractor UPSERTs incrementally after each turn. Same `user_id` equality check as above.

```json
{
  "user_id": "8a1f0c2e-4b6d-4f8a-9c31-2d5e7f0a1b3c",
  "city": "Hong Kong",
  "location": null,
  "hometown": null,
  "nationality": null,
  "occupation": "graphic designer",
  "mbti_guess": "INFP",
  "love_values": null,
  "emotional_needs": null,
  "life_rhythm": null,
  "interests": ["jazz", "long walks"],
  "personality_traits": [],
  "preferred_gender": null,
  "age_min": null,
  "age_max": null,
  "deal_breakers": [],
  "education": null,
  "family": null,
  "relationship_history": null,
  "social_pattern": null,
  "future_plans": null,
  "finance_status": null,
  "updated_at": "2026-08-11T12:00:00Z"
}
```

`updated_at: null` means the user has no `human_insights` row yet — no extraction has landed — and every other field is `null`/`[]` in that response. There is no aggregate "training level" score anymore; `agent_training_level` and the raw `companion_insights` JSONB were removed with the companion_insights teardown (spec 2026-08-11) — the typed columns above are the whole surface now.

### `GET /comp/instance/{instance_id}/profile`

The flat, typed `character_insights` row for one relationship (`persona_instances.id`) — the AI character's own conversation-derived profile, the mirror of the human profile above. The instance's `owner_uid` MUST match the JWT's user_id; otherwise 403. An unknown or archived (`status <> 'active'`) instance is 404. Experimental (v1.3.0) — see [2026-08-15-character-insights-design.md](superpowers/specs/2026-08-15-character-insights-design.md).

```json
{
  "instance_id": "8a1f0c2e-4b6d-4f8a-9c31-2d5e7f0a1b3c",
  "location": "the office, working late",
  "occupation": null,
  "current_situation": null,
  "desires": null,
  "vulnerabilities": null,
  "habits": null,
  "personal_values": null,
  "likes": [],
  "dislikes": [],
  "relationships": [],
  "updated_at": "2026-08-15T12:00:00Z"
}
```

`updated_at: null` means this instance has no `character_insights` row yet — the character extraction chain has not produced a result — and every other field is `null`/`[]` in that response, same convention as the human profile above. Four of these fields — `current_situation`, `occupation`, `location`, `relationships` — are read back into the chat prompt as the `[character_state]` block, and the fill level of all ten sizes the injected history window (see [Deploying → Operational notes](deploying.md#operational-notes)); the other six are database-only.

This route is v1 and frozen — it keeps working and is not going away. The v2
equivalent, with the same fields under the v2 path convention, is
`GET /v2/comp/instance/{instance_id}/insight/character` (below).

### `GET /v2/comp/instance/{instance_id}/insight/character`

`CharacterInsightResponse` — the `character_insights` row, under the v2 API
convention (the entity segment before the id names what the id belongs to;
`insight` replaces v1's overloaded `profile`). Same fields as v1's
[`GET /comp/instance/{instance_id}/profile`](#get-compinstanceinstance_idprofile)
above. `GET`, authenticated, keyed on the relationship rather than the user:
the instance's `owner_uid` must equal the JWT's user_id, else `403`; an
unknown or archived (`status <> 'active'`) instance is `404`; no row yet is
`200` with every field `null`/`[]` and `updated_at: null` — same convention
as the v1 routes.

```json
{
  "instance_id": "8a1f0c2e-4b6d-4f8a-9c31-2d5e7f0a1b3c",
  "location": null,
  "occupation": null,
  "current_situation": null,
  "desires": null,
  "vulnerabilities": null,
  "habits": null,
  "personal_values": null,
  "likes": [],
  "dislikes": [],
  "relationships": [],
  "updated_at": null
}
```

### `GET /v2/comp/instance/{instance_id}/insight/user`

`UserInsightResponse` — the `user_insights` row, the real user's profile
*inside this one relationship*. Same ten fields, same shape, same ownership/
404/no-row rules as `.../insight/character` above. **This is not
`human_insights`**, the global profile served at
[`GET /comp/user/{user_id}/profile`](#get-compuseruser_idprofile) above:
`user_insights` is per-relationship, database-only, and record-only —
nothing reads it back into any chat, voice, or PDE prompt. Experimental
(v1.6.0) — see
[2026-08-22-user-insights-and-api-v2-design.md](superpowers/specs/2026-08-22-user-insights-and-api-v2-design.md).

### `DELETE /comp/instance/{instance_id}/sessions`

Soft-delete every session this user holds with one persona instance. The instance's `owner_uid` MUST match the JWT's user_id; otherwise 403. An unknown instance is 404 — unlike the profile route above, a dormant (`status <> 'active'`) instance is accepted, because a client may clear the conversations of a relationship it has already marked over.

```json
{
  "instance_id": "8a1f0c2e-4b6d-4f8a-9c31-2d5e7f0a1b3c",
  "archived_sessions": 2
}
```

`archived_sessions` counts the sessions flipped by *this* call, so a repeat call returns `200` with `0`. Every channel is archived, voice included — the unit is the relationship, not one client's view of it.

**What is deleted:** `companion_affinity` (and its events, by cascade), the relationship layer of `companion_memories`, and `character_insights` — the state that would otherwise carry into the next conversation. **What is not:** `chat_messages`. The transcript stays, so the audit tables that reference a session by id (`companion_decision_events`, `character_insights_events`, `chat_vision_events`, `chat_images_events`) still point at something readable. The profile layer of `companion_memories` (`instance_id IS NULL`) also stays — those are cross-persona facts about the user.

Afterwards the sessions are invisible everywhere: history, affinity, the session list, the chat and voice turn routes all return 404 or omit them, and `POST /comp/chat/start` creates a new session rather than resuming an archived one.

There is no restore endpoint by design. Reviving one session is an operator action:

```sql
UPDATE engine.chat_sessions SET archived = false WHERE id = '<session-uuid>';
```

The transcript comes back; the relationship state does not. See [2026-08-18-session-soft-delete-design.md](superpowers/specs/2026-08-18-session-soft-delete-design.md).

> **Tips replaced gift events.** The standalone gift routes
> (`POST /comp/chat/{session_id}/event/gift`, `GET /comp/chat/{session_id}/gifts`)
> were removed. A tip is now part of a normal stream turn — set
> `tips_amount_usd` on `POST /comp/chat/{session_id}/message/stream` (see above).

## World Town

The user's world publishes a town feed: posts written by their persona
instances, each with a comment thread. Both routes carry the same JWT contract
as `/comp/*` — the path `user_id` must equal the JWT `sub`, otherwise `403`.
Rendering is entirely downstream's job; these endpoints only move data. What
decides that a post gets written at all — enrolment, tick intervals, cooldowns,
the daily cap — is in [World system](world-system.md).

### `GET /world/town/{user_id}/feed?limit=20&cursor=`

Published posts, newest first, each with its full comment thread inlined.
`limit` defaults to 20 and is clamped to 50. A user who is not enrolled, or
whose town is switched off, gets an **empty feed, not an error**.

```json
{
  "user_id": "…",
  "posts": [
    {
      "post_id": "…",
      "instance_id": "…",
      "author_name": "Ada",
      "content": "…",
      "published_at": "…",
      "comments": [
        {
          "comment_id": "…",
          "author_instance_id": "…",
          "author_name": "Bishop",
          "content": "…",
          "created_at": "…"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "next_cursor": "2026-08-17T04:12:00+00:00|<post uuid>"
}
```

- `next_cursor` — present only when another page may exist; feed it back
  verbatim as `cursor`. Treat it as opaque. A cursor that does not parse is a
  `400 bad_request`, not an empty page.
- `comments[].author_instance_id` — `null` when the comment is the user's own;
  otherwise the persona instance that wrote it.

### `POST /world/town/{user_id}/posts/{post_id}/comments`

Adds a user comment to a post in that user's own town.

```json
{ "content": "…" }
```

`content` is trimmed, then must be non-empty and at most 1000 characters —
`400` otherwise. Returns the created comment in the same shape as a
`comments[]` entry above. A post that is not visible to this user is `404`,
including one that exists in someone else's town.

## BFF (`/bff/v1/*`)

A frontend-shaped mirror of selected `/comp/*` routes for first-party
clients. Same Supabase JWT auth and the same per-user ownership checks as
the canonical routes — only the **response shape** differs (slimmer DTOs,
bundled payloads). Canonical `/comp/*` routes are never reshaped to fit a
frontend; a BFF route is added alongside instead. Five routes exist today.

### `POST /bff/v1/comp/chat/start`

Cold-mount bundle: resolves (or creates) the session **and** returns its
recent history in one round-trip, collapsing the frontend's separate
`start` + `history` calls. For the same user + input it resolves to the
exact same session as the canonical `POST /comp/chat/start`.

The body is the canonical start body plus one BFF-only field:

- `genome_id` / `instance_id` — identify the persona (same as canonical).
- `is_demo` — optional, same as canonical.
- `history_limit` — optional bundled-history page size; default 50, capped at 50.
- `force_new` — optional, same as canonical. Passed through to
  `StartChatRequest::force_new` — skip resume and always create a fresh
  session (`is_new: true`); recommended for voice calls (see the
  [voice section](#post-compvoicesession_idturnstream) above).

```json
{
  "session_id": "5f7e…",
  "instance_id": "…",
  "persona_name": "Aria",
  "is_new": false,
  "history": [
    { "id": "3cc06c53-…", "client_msg_id": "c_abc", "role": "user",      "content": "hello",   "sent_at": "…" },
    { "id": "9f2e7a10-…", "client_msg_id": null,    "role": "assistant", "content": "hi back", "sent_at": "…" }
  ]
}
```

Affinity is intentionally **not** bundled here — the frontend reads it
separately via the two affinity routes below, so a cold mount that does not
need a relationship pays nothing for one.

### `GET /bff/v1/comp/chat/{session_id}/history?limit=50&offset=0`

Slim history projection for the chat screen: `id` / `client_msg_id` /
`role` / `content` / `sent_at` (no `extracted_facts`), plus `tips_amount_usd`
on tip rows (present only when `role = gift_user`; omitted otherwise), and an
optional `channel` field — `"product_qa"` marks an out-of-character product
answer (excluded from companion context/memory); omitted for normal turns —
and `read_at`, the read receipt described under `POST /comp/chat/{session_id}/read`
(omitted while unread). `id` is the
`chat_messages` row primary key (UUID); `client_msg_id` is the id the FE
sent during streaming (`null` for rows that never carried one, e.g.
assistant turns). `image: true` marks an assistant row whose turn delegated
an image (omitted on every other row, never `false`) — the same key-presence
contract and `image-request` discovery semantics as the canonical history
route above, including the "404 on a flagged row = unrecoverable" reading.
The `POST /bff/v1/comp/chat/start` bundle serializes history through this
same entry shape and therefore carries the flag too. `user_message_id` names the
`role='user'` row whose turn produced this row — present on assistant rows and
on `system_error` notices, omitted on user rows. `reply_to_message_id`
echoes the quote a `user` row was sent with (see the stream route's
**Optional: quote** section) — the id of the row it quoted, always in this same
session; omitted on ordinary turns and on turns whose anchor failed to resolve,
so a cold mount can re-render the quote without keeping local state. Same auth, ownership check, and
`limit ∈ [1, 50]` clamp as the canonical history route. **Intentional
divergence:** the default `limit` is 50 (the canonical route defaults to 20),
because the BFF exists for a cold mount that wants a full backscroll in one
round-trip.

```json
{
  "session_id": "…",
  "messages": [
    { "id": "3cc06c53-…", "client_msg_id": "c_abc", "role": "user",      "content": "alpha", "sent_at": "…", "read_at": "…" },
    { "id": "9f2e7a10-…", "client_msg_id": null,    "role": "assistant", "content": "beta",  "sent_at": "…", "read_at": "…" },
    { "id": "a1b2c3d4-…", "client_msg_id": null,    "role": "assistant", "content": "gamma", "sent_at": "…", "channel": "product_qa" },
    { "id": "b5c6d7e8-…", "client_msg_id": null,    "role": "assistant", "content": "",      "sent_at": "…", "image": true },
    { "id": "c9d0e1f2-…", "client_msg_id": "c_def", "role": "user",      "content": "wait, about that", "sent_at": "…", "reply_to_message_id": "3cc06c53-…" }
  ],
  "total": 5
}
```

`total` is the count of `messages` in **this** response (`== messages.len()`),
not the grand total of rows in the session.

### `GET /bff/v1/comp/affinity/{session_id}/event`

Latest user-turn affinity delta (the applied per-axis change) **plus the
post-turn absolute state**, for per-turn frontend observation. JWT + ownership
checked.

Query parameters (both optional):

- `after` — long-poll baseline: the `event_id` the caller already has. While
  the session's latest turn event still matches it (or none exists yet), the
  request is held open until a newer event lands or `wait` elapses — a
  timed-out response returns the unchanged state, same shape as the immediate
  path. Absent ⇒ the latest event is returned immediately.
- `wait` — how long to hold the request open, in milliseconds. Only
  meaningful with `after`. Default 10000, server-capped at 25000.

```json
{
  "session_id": "…",
  "event": {
    "event_id": "…",
    "event_type": "message",
    "effective_deltas": {
      "warmth": 0.03, "trust": 0.01, "intrigue": 0.0,
      "intimacy": 0.0, "patience": 0.0, "tension": -0.01
    },
    "effective_deltas_computed": {
      "bond": 0.013,
      "chemistry": 0.006
    },
    "label_changes": {
      "bond": { "from": "friend", "to": "close_friend" }
    },
    "state_after": {
      "warmth": 0.31, "trust": 0.44, "intrigue": 0.40,
      "intimacy": 0.19, "patience": 0.27, "tension": 0.17,
      "bond": 0.42, "chemistry": 0.18,
      "bond_tier": 3, "chem_tier": 2,
      "warmth_grade": 2, "patience_grade": 2,
      "ghost_streak": 0, "total_ghosts": 2,
      "updated_at": "2026-08-17T14:02:11.412Z"
    },
    "user_message_id": "…",
    "created_at": "…"
  }
}
```

`event` is `null` when there is no user-turn event yet (brand-new session,
or only time-decay), or when the latest event predates affinity migration
`0014`. `event_type` ∈ `message | gift | proactive | ghost`; a ghost turn
reports all-zero `effective_deltas`.

- `effective_deltas_computed` — exact floored per-turn line delta computed at
  persist time from the floored before/after bond/chemistry scores; read from
  the stored event column. Composite-score units — the same 0..1 scale as the
  snapshot's `bond`/`chemistry`. Good for a "+X bond / +Y chemistry" per-turn
  pulse. May be absent on pre-migration rows.
- `label_changes` — engine-authoritative tier transition (`null` / absent when
  no tier crossed this turn). Frontend stops computing this itself.
- `state_after` — the post-turn absolute state, read from the stored event
  column (absent on rows written before migration `0049`). This replaces
  client-side accumulation: adopt it as the new absolute value each turn
  instead of adding deltas to a running total. It is a **write-time**
  snapshot — after an absence only `GET /bff/v1/comp/affinity/{session_id}`
  is correct, because that route refreshes the derived endpoints at read.
- `user_message_id` — the user message (`chat_messages.id`) that drove this
  turn; attach the delta to that message or to its replies
  (`chat_messages.user_message_id`). Absent on `proactive` / `time_decay`
  events and on rows written before migration `0056`.

### `GET /bff/v1/comp/affinity/{session_id}`

Absolute affinity for the session, **refreshed at read time** — the supported
way for a client to render a relationship. JWT + ownership checked, same
status codes as the event route above (404 unknown session, 403 someone
else's).

```json
{
  "session_id": "…",
  "affinity": {
    "warmth": 0.3106, "trust": 0.4402, "intrigue": 0.4024,
    "intimacy": 0.1901, "patience": 0.2740, "tension": 0.1703,
    "bond": 0.4213, "chemistry": 0.1802,
    "bond_tier": 3, "chem_tier": 2,
    "bond_label": "close_friend", "chemistry_label": "flirtation",
    "ghost_streak": 0, "total_ghosts": 2,
    "updated_at": "2026-08-17T14:02:11Z"
  }
}
```

`affinity` is `null` when the session has no affinity row yet — the row is
created on the first turn, so a just-started session legitimately has none.

- `bond` / `chemistry` — the real stored composite scores (0–1); no display
  curve (the pacing nonlinearity lives in the write-side tier decay — see
  [affinity-model.md](affinity-model.md)).
- `bond_tier` / `chem_tier` — 1..=5. Returned alongside the keys so a client
  needs neither the thresholds nor an ordered tier array. **Do not re-derive
  the tier from the score**; the thresholds are engine-owned and a local copy
  will drift.
- `bond_label` ∈ `acquaintance | friend | close_friend | confidant | soulmate`
- `chemistry_label` ∈ `spark | flirtation | crush | lover | beloved`

`apply_time_decay()` + `refresh_endpoints()` run before the response is
serialised, and that is the reason to call this rather than read
`engine.companion_affinity` directly: `warmth` and `patience` are derived from
the judge level, the counterpart line and the elapsed gap, with the stored
columns holding only a write-time cache. A direct `SELECT` returns a
relationship that reads warmer the longer the user has been away.

### `GET /bff/v1/comp/affinities/{user_id}`

Every companion's current affinity for one user, in one round trip — the list
form of the route above, for a client rendering one row per companion. The
`{user_id}` path parameter MUST match the JWT's user_id; mismatch returns 403.

| Query param | Default | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| `limit` | 50 | Clamped to 1..=200, never rejected. |
| `cursor` | — | Opaque, taken verbatim from the previous page's `next_cursor`. Malformed ⇒ 400. |

```json
{
  "user_id": "…",
  "items": [
    {
      "session_id": "…",
      "genome_id": "…",
      "affinity": { "…": "identical to the single-session shape above" }
    }
  ],
  "next_cursor": null
}
```

- **Every row gets the same read-time refresh** as the single-session route. A
  row that skipped it would be no better than the stored columns.
- `genome_id` is the companion the relationship is with — a list keyed by
  companion joins on it without a second round trip.
- Ordered `updated_at DESC, session_id DESC`, so page one holds the rows a list
  actually shows first. The cursor is a keyset on that pair; `session_id`
  breaks timestamp ties, which is what keeps a page boundary landing on a tie
  from skipping a row or serving it twice.
- `next_cursor` is `null` on the last page — walk until it is.
- **A session with no affinity row is absent**, not present with
  `affinity: null`. The list is driven by the relationships themselves, so
  "missing from the response" means "no relationship yet" — the state the
  single-session route reports as `affinity: null`.
- No per-session 403/404: the response only ever contains rows the caller owns,
  so a foreign or unknown session is simply absent.

## Error responses

Most errors are JSON with `{"error": "<code>", "message": "<human-readable>"}`.
The streaming routes (`POST /comp/chat/{session_id}/message/stream`, `POST
/comp/voice/{session_id}/turn/stream`, and `POST
/persona/{instance_id}/image/compose`) are the exception: most of the
failure modes on all three routes use the `code` / `message` /
`user_message` shape described under "Pre-stream errors" above, with no
`"error"` key. `POST /comp/voice/{session_id}/turn/interrupt` shares that
same error body shape even though it is not itself a stream (its success
response is plain JSON) — it reuses the voice turn's precondition checks and
error type. The table below covers the plain shape:

| Status | Code | When |
|--------|------|------|
| 400 | `bad_request` | Malformed body, invalid UUID, missing required field |
| 401 | `unauthorized` | Missing / malformed / expired / wrong-secret JWT |
| 403 | `forbidden` | Path-user vs JWT-user mismatch, or trying to read a session you don't own |
| 404 | `not_found` | Unknown session / persona / message id |
| 500 | `internal` | Anything else (DB error, LLM API error, etc.) |
| *the provider's own status* | `upstream` | The upstream provider failed the call (currently only the persona compose endpoint — its composer chain was exhausted). Since v1.4.0 this is **not always 502**: the provider's status passes through verbatim (`529`, `503`, `429`, …), and a gateway-layer failure with no upstream status maps to `504` for a timeout and `502` otherwise. The body carries `upstream_status` / `provider_code` / `error_type` or `gateway_kind`, plus `retryable` — see [the compose endpoint](#post-personainstance_idimagecompose). Branch on the `"error": "upstream"` key, not on the status. |
