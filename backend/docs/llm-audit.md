# LLM audit passthrough

eros-engine exposes an opaque OpenRouter passthrough on the streaming
chat endpoint. Three caller-supplied fields ride to
`openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions` unchanged, three OpenRouter wire
echoes come back on the SSE `done` frame, and a deployer-declared
`headers` table adds app-attribution headers to every outbound call.

The engine never inspects content. PII scrubbing, hashing, and
metadata semantics are the caller's responsibility.

## Inbound: the `audit` request field

`POST /comp/chat/{session_id}/message/stream` and
`POST /v2/comp/session/{session_id}/message/async` both accept an optional
`audit` object alongside the required `content` / `client_msg_id` — on the
async endpoint the field rides the queue and is re-validated in the worker:

```jsonc
{
  "content": "...",
  "client_msg_id": "01J3333333333333333333333A",
  "audit": {
    "user": "u_<hash-of-internal-id>",     // optional
    "session_id": "conv_xyz",               // optional, ≠ URL session UUID
    "metadata": {                           // optional
      "feature": "chat",
      "plan": "pro"
    }
  }
}
```

Caps enforced at the engine before forwarding:

| Field                  | Cap                                              |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `audit.user`           | `chars ≤ 256`                                    |
| `audit.session_id`     | `chars ≤ 256`                                    |
| `audit.metadata` keys  | `≤ 16`                                           |
| `audit.metadata` key   | regex `^[A-Za-z0-9_.-]{1,64}$`                   |
| `audit.metadata` value | JSON string, `chars ≤ 512`                       |

Violations return `400 BadRequest` as a pre-stream error, and no user
message row is persisted.

**Privacy:** do not put raw email / wallet address / real name in
`user` — send a hash. OpenRouter retains request metadata (token
counts, latency) but not prompts / responses by default.

## Outbound: the `usage` echo on the SSE `done` frame

The streaming endpoint's `done` frame carries three optional fields:

| Field           | Type      | Meaning                                                                                       |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `usage`         | `object?` | OpenRouter `usage` block verbatim (tokens / cost / cached / reasoning). Engine does not flatten. |
| `generation_id` | `string?` | OpenRouter `response.id`. Query `/api/v1/generation` with it for full request metadata later. |
| `model`         | `string?` | Model OpenRouter actually served. When `fallback_model` was hit, this is the fallback.        |

These fields appear on the `done` frame (the per-turn terminal frame
before `final`). Background paths (dreaming / post_process) do **not**
surface them to clients.

### Hiding fields from the response

Deployers can strip specific top-level keys from the `usage` echo by
setting `OPENROUTER_USAGE_HIDDEN_KEYS` (comma-separated) on the server.
Typical use: hide wholesale `cost` / `cost_details` from downstream
customers without losing visibility for the operator.

```bash
OPENROUTER_USAGE_HIDDEN_KEYS=cost,cost_details
```

Behaviour:

- Applies to the SSE streaming `done` frame on both
  `/comp/chat/{id}/message/stream` and
  `/comp/voice/{session_id}/turn/stream`.
- The full unfiltered `usage` is still persisted to the DB; only the
  client-facing payload is filtered.
- Does **not** affect `tracing::info!` output — operator observability
  stays intact regardless of this setting.
- Background paths (dreaming / post_process) already don't return
  `usage` to clients, so the env var has no effect on them.
- Only top-level keys are stripped; to suppress a whole subtree, list
  its parent key (`cost_details` removes the entire object, not just
  its members).
- Unset or empty → today's pass-through behaviour.

Background paths (`pipeline::dreaming`, `pipeline::post_process`,
`pipeline::world`, `pipeline::story`) never surface these three fields on a
client frame — there is no client connected to them. What they do produce,
via `pipeline::record_generation`, is the same `tracing::info!` line every
other call site emits, plus — since migration `0059` — one row in
`engine.llm_generations`; see [LLM generations
ledger](#llm-generations-ledger) below.

```
openrouter: call completed session=… generation_id=… model=…
prompt_tokens=… completion_tokens=… total_tokens=… cost=…
```

- `world_director` — World Memories director sweeper (background). One call
  per enrolled owner per `interval_hours`. `user` =
  `11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111112` (world subsystem sentinel, distinct
  from dreaming's `11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111`). Recorded as
  `task = "world_director"`; nothing on any client frame.
- `world_comment` — World Town hourly comment round (background). One
  batched call per owner with new feed activity. `user` =
  `11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111112` (shared world-subsystem sentinel).
  Recorded as `task = "world_comment"`; nothing on any client frame.
- `world_reply` — World Town reply responder (background). One call per
  debounced user comment, capped per owner per UTC day. Same sentinel user;
  recorded as `task = "world_reply"`; nothing on any client frame.
- `world_stories_director` — World Stories director (background), module
  `pipeline::story`. Runs as the second phase of the same sweeper tick as
  `world_director`; one call per claimed persona instance per its own
  `interval_hours`. `user` = `11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111113` (story
  subsystem sentinel, continuing the dreaming/world sequence). Recorded as
  `task = "world_stories_director"`; nothing on any client frame.

## LLM generations ledger

Migration `0059` adds `engine.llm_generations`, one row per **billable LLM
generation** — a provider response that carried a `generation_id`, which is
the unit the provider bills and the unit its own log exposes:

```sql
CREATE TABLE engine.llm_generations (
    generation_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    session_id    UUID REFERENCES engine.chat_sessions(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    task          TEXT NOT NULL,
    model         TEXT,
    usage         JSONB,
    created_at    TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

`pipeline::record_generation` writes this row from every LLM call site in the
engine, replacing the old `log_openrouter_usage`. It still emits the
identical `openrouter: call completed` tracing line shown above — the row is
in addition to that line, not instead of it.

**Full task vocabulary.** Every `[tasks.*]` key that makes a chat-completion
call now writes here: `chat_companion`, `chat_voice`, `chat_product_qa`,
`chat_input_filter`, `chat_output_filter`, `chat_vision`,
`chat_image_prompt_compose`, `chat_image_edit_compose`, `pde_decision`,
`affinity_evaluation`, `affinity_summary`, `insight_extraction`,
`insight_structuring`, `character_insight_extraction`,
`character_insight_structuring`, `user_insight_extraction`,
`user_insight_structuring`, `memory_extraction`, `world_director`,
`world_stories_director`, `world_comment`, `world_reply`.

**Five of those previously wrote nothing to the database at all** —
`world_director`, `world_stories_director`, `world_comment`, `world_reply`,
`memory_extraction`. `engine.llm_generations` is now their only record.

### Reading it

`usage` is stored **unfiltered** — whatever the provider sent, `cost`
included when the provider sent one. `OPENROUTER_USAGE_HIDDEN_KEYS` strips
keys only on the way out to clients (see above); the database has always kept
the whole object and continues to.

Cost per task for a window. **Never sum `cost` without also counting how many
rows carried one:**

```sql
SELECT task,
       count(*)                                                       AS calls,
       count(*) FILTER (WHERE jsonb_typeof(usage->'cost') = 'number') AS priced,
       sum((usage->>'cost')::numeric)
         FILTER (WHERE jsonb_typeof(usage->'cost') = 'number')        AS cost_of_priced
FROM engine.llm_generations
WHERE created_at >= now() - interval '7 days'
GROUP BY task ORDER BY cost_of_priced DESC NULLS LAST;
```

**Both halves filter on the value's type, not on the key's presence.**
`usage ? 'cost'` is the obvious spelling and is wrong twice: a `"cost": null`
counts as priced while adding nothing to the sum, and a non-numeric value —
`"cost": "unknown"`, or an object — makes `::numeric` **raise** and abort the
query instead of yielding `NULL`. `usage` is stored verbatim from the
provider's response and the engine does not validate its shape, so the query
has to. `jsonb_typeof(usage->'cost') = 'number'` is false for a JSON null, a
non-number, a missing key, and a `NULL` `usage` alike.

**`cost` is a provider-dependent key.** OpenRouter returns it inside `usage`;
Venice direct does not emit it at all. A deployment that mixes the two — as
the reference one does — gets `cost` on only part of its rows.

`priced` is what makes the sum readable: it counts the rows carrying a
**numeric** cost, which is exactly the set the sum is taken over. A task
served entirely by an unpriced provider sums to `NULL`, which is honest and
obvious. The trap is a
**mixed** task: one `[tasks.*]` whose primary is priced and whose fallback is
not returns a plausible-looking total that silently covers a fraction of its
calls. Read `priced / calls` before believing `cost_of_priced`.

The engine does not derive the missing cost from tokens and a price table.
That would make it a second authority on what a call cost, drifting against
the provider's real pricing with nothing to signal the drift. For unpriced
rows the provider's dashboard is the authority, and `generation_id` is the
join key to it — which is what this table exists to give you.

### Failure semantics: fail-open

The only structural cause the schema itself can produce for a parent write
failing is `session_id` failing its foreign key: `task`, `model`, and
`usage` carry no constraint that can fail, and a `generation_id` collision is
absorbed by `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`. Anything else is a transient database
error. Either way, the helper logs a `warn!` and returns `None` rather than
failing the turn; the caller stores that `None` as `NULL` in its own child
`generation_id` column, and the reply is served exactly as it would have
been.

**The client sees the same degradation.** Every streaming arm's wire `done`
frame sources its `generation_id` from what `record_generation` returned, not
from the provider response directly — so a degraded parent write blanks that
field on the frame the client receives for that turn too, not only the row
in the database. The frame then matches the DB (both `NULL`), which is the
point, but it means an internal audit-write failure is visible on the wire.

**A degraded write now loses the whole record, for every task.** It used to
lose only the join key: each child row set its own `model` and `usage`
straight from the provider response, so those survived. **The child tables no
longer carry those columns at all** — `engine.llm_generations` is the one
place a generation's model and spend live, reached by joining on
`generation_id`. So when the parent write degrades, the child row stores
`NULL` and there is nothing to join to; the tracing line above and the
provider's own log are what is left. That was already true of the five
background sweepers (`world_director`, `world_stories_director`,
`world_comment`, `world_reply`, `memory_extraction`), which write no child
row at all. It is now true of everything.

**The same applies to a response that carries no `generation_id`.**
`record_generation` logs the line and then short-circuits, because the id is
the primary key — so a provider that answers without one produces a billable
call with no row anywhere, and its model survives only in the tracing output.
Rare in practice (OpenRouter always returns an id) but real for the
salvaged-garble fallback and for direct providers that omit it.

### The foreign keys

**The child tables' `generation_id` columns — `chat_messages`,
`companion_affinity_events`, `companion_insights_events`,
`companion_decision_events`, `chat_images_events`, `chat_vision_events`,
`character_insights_events`, `user_insights_events` — each reference this
table**, `ON DELETE SET NULL`, and each is indexed. Migration `0060` added
them, together with a backfill of every pre-existing row and an index on each
column.

They could not ship with the write path itself: `fly.toml` runs the migration
before traffic moves to the new machines, so a foreign key added in the same
release as the code that populates the parent would have rejected inserts
from the previous build still serving live traffic. Hence two releases.

The constraints are **validated**, not `NOT VALID` — the retrospective
guarantee holds, so a row pointing at a generation that was never recorded
cannot exist.

**`chat_messages.f_generation_id` is the exception: it has no foreign key,
and will not get one.** It is a ninth `generation_id`-bearing
column — the filter generation, distinct from `chat_messages.generation_id`
above — written by a separate `mark_filtered` `UPDATE` path that would need
its own degrade branch, and production carries exactly one non-null value in
it. This is a permanent decision (design spec §7.2), not an oversight.

### One row per billed response, not one per turn

**A chain that walks several fallback models writes several rows for one
turn.** Every candidate response that carried a `generation_id` gets its own
row, whether or not its content is the one ultimately served — each was
separately billed, so each is the intended unit. A row nothing points at is
normal and is often the most useful row in the table: it is spend that
appears nowhere else.

That holds on every arm. The voice arm, the product-QA arm and the standalone
compose endpoint's streaming mode each keep a working `generation_id` that
only ever holds one candidate's metadata, so they record an abandoned
candidate at the point the next one would overwrite it, and record the last
candidate before any early return that would otherwise skip it.

One case looks like an exception and is not: when a product-QA chain is spent
and a canned `error_handling` phrase is served instead, the generation is in
`llm_generations` with its real usage, while the persisted `chat_messages`
row carries `generation_id` as `NULL`. Both are deliberate. The call was billed, so it is audited; the message's content came
from a phrase table, not from that call, so attributing it would poison
reconciliation.

## App-attribution headers

Declare a `headers` table on `[providers.openrouter]` in the model config
(`docs/model-config.md` → "Built-in endpoint overrides via
`[providers].openrouter`") to add headers to every outbound OpenRouter
call:

```toml
[providers.openrouter]
headers = {
  "HTTP-Referer" = "https://eros.example",
  "X-OpenRouter-Title" = "Eros",
  "X-OpenRouter-Categories" = "companion,roleplay",
}
```

| Purpose-built header      | Meaning                                          |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `HTTP-Referer`             | App identifier on OpenRouter dashboards          |
| `X-OpenRouter-Title`       | Display name in OpenRouter app analytics         |
| `X-OpenRouter-Categories`  | Comma-separated marketplace categories           |

No `[providers.openrouter]` entry, or one without `headers` → today's
behaviour (no attribution headers). They are set per deployment, not per
request — App-Attribution is intended for app-level aggregation. Per-user
attribution belongs in `audit.user`.

`X-OpenRouter-Categories` is passed through verbatim; OpenRouter silently
ignores unrecognised values and only honours it when `HTTP-Referer` is
also set.

Header names/values are validated at boot — engine-owned names
(`Authorization`, `Content-Type`, case-insensitive) or anything that isn't
valid HTTP header material refuses the load, rather than the older
construction-time warn-and-drop.

**Migration note:** the `OPENROUTER_APP_REFERER` / `OPENROUTER_APP_TITLE` /
`OPENROUTER_APP_CATEGORIES` env vars are soft-deprecated — a still-set
value is silently ignored, never a boot error, but it no longer does
anything. Re-declare the same headers under `[providers.openrouter].headers`
as shown above.

## What the engine does NOT do

- **Persist the `audit` object.** No DB column stores the caller-supplied
  `audit` (`user` / `session_id` / `metadata`) or the attribution headers —
  those are surface fields only, forwarded upstream and then dropped. The
  OpenRouter `model` / `usage` / `generation_id` triple **is** persisted —
  `model` and `usage` in `engine.llm_generations`, and `generation_id` on the
  row that call produced: `chat_messages.generation_id` for the chat completion
  (mirrored on `companion_affinity_events` for the affinity eval, on
  `companion_insights_events` for each `insight_extraction` /
  `insight_structuring` call of the human chain, on
  `engine.character_insights_events` for each call of the experimental
  character chain and on `engine.user_insights_events` for each call of the
  experimental user chain (§"Character and user insights" below), on
  `companion_decision_events` for each `pde_decision` judge run, on
  `chat_images_events` for every image-composer call, and on
  `chat_vision_events` for every `chat_vision` describe — see
  [Image-path event tables](#image-path-event-tables) below;
  `chat_messages.metadata.image` keeps its existing `compose_*` keys plus a
  `compose_event_id` pointer into `chat_images_events`) — see the `usage`
  filtering note above. Since the companion_insights
  teardown (spec 2026-08-11), `companion_insights_events` rows can contain
  keys the typed `human_insights` store never persists: the extractor's
  `existing_insights` context is now reverse-projected from `human_insights`
  (not the retired JSONB blob), and any off-schema key the LLM emits still
  lands in the event payload but nowhere else — a future events↔store
  reconciliation has to compare on payload keys ∩ `human_insights` column
  set, not full equality. Since migration `0059`, every one of the calls
  above — plus `chat_voice`, `chat_product_qa`, `chat_input_filter`,
  `chat_output_filter`, and the five background sweepers that wrote none of
  the above — also lands one row in `engine.llm_generations`; see [LLM
  generations ledger](#llm-generations-ledger) above.
- **Hash.** The engine does not transform `user` — callers are
  responsible for sending a hash.
- **Sanitise.** `metadata` keys and values are size / shape-checked,
  not content-checked.
- **Interpret.** The engine does not group, aggregate, or alert on
  any audit field. Callers wire that themselves.

## Failed attempts: `llm_attempts` / `gateway_errors`

Since **v1.4.0** (store migration `0050`) five tables carry the same two
nullable `JSONB` columns, recording every LLM attempt that **failed** —
including attempts a fallback recovered from, which leave no other trace:

| Table | Call sites it hosts |
|---|---|
| `engine.chat_messages` | the chat model chain, the output filter, the input filter |
| `engine.chat_vision_events` | `chat_vision` describe |
| `engine.chat_images_events` | image-prompt composer |
| `engine.companion_decision_events` | PDE judge |
| `engine.companion_affinity_events` | affinity eval |

Identical shape on all five, so a fleet-wide error view is one `UNION ALL`.
Additive, nullable, no backfill, no index. **`NULL` means "nothing to
record"** — an empty array is never written, so there is exactly one way to
say "no failure". Design:
[LLM error audit spec](superpowers/specs/2026-08-18-llm-error-audit-design.md);
consumer-facing changes:
[migrating/v1-4-0-llm-error-audit.md](migrating/v1-4-0-llm-error-audit.md).

### Three homes, split by who authored the fact

Not by which code path produced it. Each fact has exactly one home, so the
three never overlap.

| Home | Holds | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| `llm_attempts` | What the **upstream** said | The provider spoke: a non-2xx status, or a `200` body carrying an error envelope |
| `gateway_errors` | Where the engine's **path to the provider** broke | The provider said nothing usable: timeout, connection reset, TLS error, unparseable body |
| The table's own coarse marker (`last_failure`, `status`, `fallback_reason`, `filter_attempts[].reason`) | That row's **business verdict** | The call *succeeded* and was billed: empty completion, byte-BPE garble, refusal, length cut |

A `200 OK` stream carrying `{"error": {...}}` mid-stream, or terminating with
`finish_reason: "error"`, is an `llm_attempts` entry at `http_status: 200` —
the provider spoke, just not in the status line.

Every coarse vocabulary gained the same two **pointer values** —
`upstream_error` / `gateway_error` — which say only "an attempt failed; the
detail is in that column". The transport-shaped labels they replace are
retired; the full before/after table is in the migration guide.

**Which of the two a marker reads is decided by the whole operation, not by
its last hop.** Where the marker is operation-scoped — `last_failure` on both
event tables, `companion_decision_events.status` — it reads `upstream_error`
if the operation produced *any* `llm_attempts` entry, and `gateway_error`
otherwise. Upstream wins: "did a provider misbehave during this turn" is the
question the coarse value exists to answer at a glance, and a chain that took
a `529` and then timed out is still a turn where a provider misbehaved. The
per-hop truth is one column away. `filter_attempts[].reason` is the exception
and describes exactly one attempt each, because that array already has a row
per hop.

A **byte-BPE garble is not a `decode` gateway error**, tempting though the
name is. The call succeeded and was billed, so it is a content verdict: the
coarse marker owns it (`garbled`, or `fallback_reason = "garble_repaired"`)
and neither column carries an entry for it.

### `llm_attempts` element

```jsonc
{
  "task": "chat_companion",
  "model": "x-ai/grok-4.20",
  "http_status": 529,
  "provider_code": "529",
  "error_type": "overloaded",
  "upstream_provider_code": "anthropic:overloaded_error",
  "retry_after_s": 30,
  "message": "code=529: Overloaded"
}
```

`task` / `model` / `http_status` / `message` are always present; the other
four are omitted when absent, never nulled. `model` keeps the full config
slug including any `@provider` suffix.

`http_status` is a raw number, **never an enum**: OpenRouter reports overload
as `529` while Venice uses `429 MODEL_OVERLOADED` and `503 MODEL_AT_CAPACITY`,
and the next provider will disagree differently. Classification is by HTTP
convention (4xx client, 5xx upstream, 408/429/5xx retryable), so an
unrecognised `570` behaves sensibly. There is deliberately **no `retryable`
field** — with the status present the consumer applies the convention itself,
and the engine does not editorialise inside a column whose contract is "what
the upstream said".

`message` reuses the existing scrubbing guarantees: flattened to one bounded
line, and `metadata.flagged_input` dropped — a moderation rejection must never
echo the user's prompt back into an audit row.

### `gateway_errors` element

```jsonc
{
  "task": "chat_companion",
  "model": "x-ai/grok-4.20",
  "kind": "open_timeout",
  "message": "stream open timeout after 20s"
}
```

`task` / `kind` / `message` are always present; `model` is omitted when the
failure precedes model selection (a config error) and on the chain-scoped
`chain_exhausted`.

| `kind` | Scope | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `open_timeout` | attempt | Connect / queue / response-headers timeout |
| `total_timeout` | attempt | One attempt's whole generation exceeded its cap |
| `idle_timeout` | attempt | Byte-level idle watchdog fired mid-stream |
| `transport` | attempt | Connection reset, TLS failure, SSE body interrupted |
| `decode` | attempt | A response arrived but could not be parsed |
| `config` | attempt | Local misconfiguration (empty model slug, unresolvable provider) |
| `chain_exhausted` | chain | Every candidate failed. Carries no `model` |

The three timeouts stay distinct: folding them together once made idle
timeouts invisible. Here the distinction is SQL-queryable, not log-only.

`message` never carries a provider payload. `decode` is the one kind that could:
a `data:` frame that fails to parse is raw provider output and may hold reply
text, so the frame stays in the log line and the recorded message names only
what broke. Read the log when you need the bytes.

### The `task` discriminator

`engine.chat_messages` hosts three call sites in one pair of columns; each
element's `task` tells them apart. It is the existing `[tasks.*]` config key —
the same vocabulary already carried on the wire as `ChatRequest.task` and
already keying per-task model resolution — not a new discriminator, and
strictly finer than one would have been: it separates `chat_companion` from
`chat_voice` from `chat_product_qa`.

| `task` | Table | Row |
|---|---|---|
| `chat_companion` / `chat_voice` / `chat_product_qa` | `chat_messages` | assistant |
| `chat_output_filter` | `chat_messages` | assistant |
| `chat_input_filter` | `chat_messages` | **user** |
| `chat_vision` | `chat_vision_events` | — |
| `chat_image_prompt_compose` / `chat_image_edit_compose` | `chat_images_events` | — |
| `pde_decision` | `companion_decision_events` | — |
| `affinity_evaluation` | `companion_affinity_events` | — |

The input filter is the one call site that had **no failure record of any
kind** before v1.4.0. Its failures land on the `role='user'` row, beside the
`pre_filter_content` / `filter_model` / `filter_triggers` / `f_generation_id`
audit its *successes* already wrote there — so query the user row for them,
not the assistant row.

### Two counting traps

**`chain_exhausted` does not mean the turn was served nothing.** It is written
both on a pseudo-ghost turn and on a garble-repaired one. In the latter every
candidate genuinely did fail — the entry is correct — and the turn was then
served from a salvaged garbled hop. Read
`chat_messages.metadata.fallback_reason` alongside it to tell `stream_failure`
(canned phrase) from `garble_repaired` (salvaged text).

**One turn contributes exactly one list.** The accumulated failures are written
only on the row that **concludes** a turn — served, ghost, pseudo-ghost, or
garble-repaired. A superseded truncated bubble carries `NULL` in both columns
even though its own attempt sits in the concluding row's list. Do not sum
across a turn's rows.

### On the wire

`ProtocolFrame::Final` carries the identical structures from the identical
Rust types — one serializer, not two. `llm_attempts` / `gateway_errors` on the
`final` frame are **non-fatal**: see
[api-reference.md](api-reference.md#post-compchatsession_idmessagestream).
Affinity-eval and `chat_vision` failures are written to their tables but never
surface on the wire, by design.

## Character and user insights (experimental)

`engine.character_insights_events` and `engine.user_insights_events` are the
audit trails for the two experimental per-relationship chains —
`character_insights` (v1.3.0,
[design spec](superpowers/specs/2026-08-15-character-insights-design.md)),
the AI character's own conversation-derived profile, and `user_insights`
(v1.6.0,
[design spec](superpowers/specs/2026-08-22-user-insights-and-api-v2-design.md)),
the real user's profile *inside that one relationship*. Same table shape on
both, one row per OpenRouter call that returned a response:

- **`stage`** is `'extraction'` or `'structuring'` — naming the config block
  each row came from (`character_insight_extraction` /
  `character_insight_structuring`, or `user_insight_extraction` /
  `user_insight_structuring`), so `stage='structuring'` tells you which
  `[tasks.*]` block to go tune with no lookup table in between.
- **Both rows of one extraction run share a `run_id`** — the extraction call
  and the structuring call it fed are joinable without going through
  `session_id`/`message_id`.

**`companion_insights_events.stage` is the deliberate exception.** The human
chain's two stages now live behind their own separate config blocks too
(`insight_extraction` / `insight_structuring`, since the structuring split),
and the stage-2 call reports `insight_structuring` as its wire task name —
but the audit row it lands on still writes `stage='structured'`, not
`stage='structuring'`. `companion_insights_events` keeps its older
`'facts'`/`'structured'` vocabulary on purpose: the table is live and
downstream consumers already read it by that stage value, so renaming it to
match the two experimental tables is not worth the migration.

## Image-path event tables

Two append-only tables record every image-composer and `chat_vision`
describe call. Both are **best-effort telemetry, not a guaranteed ledger**:
the INSERT is awaited, bounded by a short `AUDIT_WRITE_TIMEOUT`, and its
error OR timeout is `warn!`ed and dropped — a failed or stalled audit
write costs the event row, never the turn (same discipline as
`companion_decision_events`). Since migration 0058 both tables — and
`companion_decision_events` and `companion_insights_events` with them — carry
real foreign keys on their `instance_id` / `session_id` / `message_id`
pointers, all `ON DELETE SET NULL` and all `NOT VALID` — binding on every row
written from here on, with the handful of pre-existing dangling ids left as
they are. A row can still outlive what it refers to; it can no longer precede
it. `user_id` deliberately carries none: an FK on the
column a row is attributed by would either delete the evidence or blank the only
handle it can be found under.

Unlike `chat_messages`, which cascades from `chat_sessions`, deleting a
session does not reach either table — it blanks the `session_id` pointer and
leaves the row, since the point of an audit table is that the trail outlives
what it points at. Both persist verbatim user text
(`chat_images_events.inputs.latest_user_msg` / `.recent_scene`;
`chat_vision_events.image_url`, often a signed, token-bearing URL). **Deployers
must include both tables in their own user-data erasure routine** — the
engine does not do this for you; erasure policy is the deployer's
responsibility, not the engine's — deleting the account does not reach these
tables either. Neither table ships with a pruning policy
either: both grow without bound for as long as the deployment runs, so plan a
partition scheme or a pruning cron yourselves if that matters for your
deployment.

### `engine.chat_images_events`

One row per image-composer LLM call, from **any** caller — a chat turn's
delegated image prompt, the standalone `POST
/persona/{instance_id}/image/compose` endpoint in either streaming mode, or
`POST /v2/comp/session/{session_id}/message/{message_id}/image/edit`.

| Column | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | `UUID` | Row id — see linkage below. |
| `source` | `TEXT` | `chat_reply_text_image` \| `chat_reply_image` \| `compose_endpoint` \| `compose_endpoint_stream` \| `image_edit` (see below). |
| `user_id` | `UUID` | |
| `instance_id` | `UUID?` | Persona instance; NULL when the caller has none in scope. |
| `session_id` | `UUID?` | Chat session; NULL on the standalone endpoint (no session). |
| `status` | `TEXT` | `ok` \| `exhausted` \| `not_configured`. |
| `inputs` | `JSONB` | The five composer slots, structured: `{appearance, recent_scene, latest_user_msg, style, aspect_ratio}`. Empty slots are `""`, not the `（无）` placeholder the prompt renders — that substitution is a rendering detail, not an input. `latest_user_msg` differs by `source`: `chat_reply_image` passes the raw `user_msg.content`, while `chat_reply_text_image` passes `effective_user_msg` — the post-input-filter rewrite. Both faithfully record what the composer actually saw on that turn; an operator diffing rows across the two sources should expect the difference, not read it as an inconsistency. |
| `subject` | `TEXT?` | The composer's own `prompt` field. NULL unless `status = "ok"`. |
| `caption` | `TEXT?` | NULL when the composer produced none, including the non-JSON fallback reply, where the whole reply becomes `subject` instead. |
| `composed_prompt` | `TEXT?` | The assembled wire string — style preset + persona appearance + subject, i.e. exactly what the downstream consumer is handed. Stored on **every** row that produced one, including `exhausted` and `not_configured` on the chat path (the portrait fallback still assembles a wire prompt, and this column is then the only record anywhere of what was drawn). NULL only on the standalone endpoint's `exhausted` rows and the `image_edit` endpoint's `exhausted` rows — both fail without assembling anything (the edit endpoint has no portrait fallback either). |
| `variant` | `TEXT?` | The resolved `prompt_variant` key; `"raw"` is an ordinary key, not a skip. |
| `generation_id` | `TEXT?` | The join key into `engine.llm_generations` — the model that answered and its usage live there, reached through this column. It is also the whole audit trail this row keeps of its own call. Populated on success, and on `exhausted` whenever the LAST attempt got a response back at all: `empty`/`empty_prompt` on the chat path and the non-stream endpoint (both walk `run_image_prompt_compose`'s shared chain), and on the standalone endpoint's streaming mode also a candidate that streamed metadata and then broke — that evidence is retained because the provider answered and may have been billed. NULL when no response ever came back on any path: a break or timeout that captured nothing at all, or `not_configured` (no call was made). **Since v1.4.0 the "did the provider answer?" test lives here** and `last_failure` no longer doubles as a coarser copy of it, which is why the two labels that used to encode it (`stream_open_failed` / `stream_died_midway`) are gone. One caveat since the `model` column went away: a provider that answers *without* an `id` now reads the same as one that never answered, because `model` used to fall back to the attempted model id and no longer exists to catch it. `attempts` and `last_failure` still separate the two. |
| `attempts` | `SMALLINT` | Models actually called off `[primary, ...fallback]`; `0` for `not_configured`. |
| `last_failure` | `TEXT?` | Why the last attempt failed; NULL when `status = "ok"` or `"not_configured"` (no attempt was made, so there is nothing to have failed). Values: `empty` \| `empty_prompt` \| `upstream_error` \| `gateway_error`. A free column, not a CHECK — the vocabulary grows as new failure modes get labeled. The first two are **content verdicts**: the call succeeded and was billed, its output was just unusable. The last two are **pointer values** naming which of the two columns below holds the per-hop detail; since v1.4.0 they replace `model_error` / `timeout` and the streaming mode's `stream_open_failed` / `stream_died_midway` — each of those covered a provider status AND a local timeout under one label, so all four are retired and the column now reads the same whichever endpoint wrote the row (see [Failed attempts](#failed-attempts-llm_attempts--gateway_errors)). **`empty` is also reachable in streaming mode**, not just the chain-walk paths — a candidate that never opens (no content chunk) but whose stream ends normally reports `empty`, same label as the chain-walk's content-level blank-reply arm, because both mean the same thing: the provider answered and may have been billed. |
| `llm_attempts` | `JSONB?` | Every hop where the provider answered with a failure. `task = "chat_image_prompt_compose"` on every row except `source = "image_edit"`, where it is `"chat_image_edit_compose"` — even when the edit ran on the compose task's fallback chain, see [Model config → image-EDIT composer](model-config.md#taskschat_image_edit_compose--image-edit-composer-optional). NULL when there were none — see [Failed attempts](#failed-attempts-llm_attempts--gateway_errors). |
| `gateway_errors` | `JSONB?` | Every hop where our path to the provider broke. NULL when there were none. |
| `created_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | |

- `image_edit` — `POST /v2/comp/session/{session_id}/message/{message_id}/image/edit`.
  Its `inputs` carries seven keys rather than the chat composer's five:
  `appearance`, `source_message_id`, `source_subject`, `source_caption`,
  `instruction`, `style`, `aspect_ratio`. `source` says which shape to expect.
  `engine.chat_images_events WHERE source = 'image_edit'` grouped by `status`
  is the reading for how often edits are asked for and how often the composer
  refuses.

`status` is deliberately three values: `exhausted` means "no usable compose
result from this call" for every reason including a mid-stream death on the
streaming endpoint, and `last_failure` carries the distinction.

**`not_configured` is unreachable on this table under current gating.**
`build_delegated_image_prompt` only runs for `ReplyImage`/`ReplyTextImage`,
which the action-plan guard only produces when
`[tasks.chat_image_prompt_compose]` is configured (`model_config` is a
boot-fixed `Arc`, no hot reload); a forced image without the task 422s at the
route before any composer call. The non-stream endpoint likewise 501s on a
missing task before doing any work. The value stays in the CHECK — narrowing
it later costs a migration, and this repo's standing bias is to keep
capability rather than remove it — and exists for a future caller that could
reach the composer without this gate, not as a state you will observe on a
live deployment today. Contrast `chat_vision_events` below, where
`not_configured` is both reachable and the single most valuable status.

**No `message_id` column.** The composer runs *before* the assistant row
exists — on the chat path the composition is `tokio::spawn`ed ahead of the
chat call so its latency hides underneath, and the assistant message id only
materialises afterward at the join point. Rather than defer the audit write
to that join point, the composer writes its event row first and returns the
row id, which is then stamped onto the assistant row as
`chat_messages.metadata.image.compose_event_id`. Reverse lookup goes
**assistant row → `compose_event_id` → this table**, never the other
direction; `chat_messages.metadata.image` otherwise keeps its existing
`compose_variant` / `compose_model` / `compose_generation_id` keys unchanged.
This direction also keeps the table reachable from callers with no message to
attach to at all (the standalone endpoint's `session_id` is NULL for exactly
that reason), and it widens coverage **on the chat path**: because
`build_delegated_image_prompt` writes its row before returning to its caller —
independent of the chat SSE stream — a chat turn whose image is never shipped
(client disconnect, a ghost fallback firing after the compose call returned)
still leaves its row behind — "model call paid for, no picture shipped"
becomes visible. **This guarantee does not extend to the standalone
endpoint's own streaming mode** (`compose_endpoint_stream`): its
`record_compose_event` calls live inside the SSE generator itself
(`routes/persona.rs::compose_stream`), so a client that disconnects before the
generator reaches one of those calls loses that row too, even though the call
was billed. The endpoint's non-stream mode (`compose_endpoint`) writes
synchronously before its HTTP response returns and is not exposed to this
gap.

### `engine.chat_vision_events`

One row per image-carrying, non-tipped chat turn **that reaches the
text-reply path**, recording the `chat_vision` describe call. A turn with no
image writes nothing — "carries an image" is the denominator, and a text turn
is not a missed describe. Neither does a turn that never reaches the
text-reply path at all: a ghosted turn, one routed to `product_qa`, or an
image-only reply all skip this write, because the describe never runs on
those paths either (running one on a ghost turn would waste a paid call).
Computing a describe success rate off this table means treating
"image-carrying turns that reached the text-reply path" as the denominator,
not every image-carrying turn — a query that doesn't exclude ghosted /
product_qa / image-only turns will overstate coverage.

| Column | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | `UUID` | |
| `user_id` | `UUID` | |
| `session_id` | `UUID?` | Always written; NULL only after 0058's `ON DELETE SET NULL` fires on a deleted session. |
| `message_id` | `UUID?` | The `role='user'` row carrying the image. Same: always written, blanked if that row is deleted. |
| `status` | `TEXT` | `ok` \| `exhausted` \| `not_configured`. |
| `image_url` | `TEXT` | |
| `vision` | `JSONB?` | The parsed describe (`description` / `ocr_text` / `people` / `scene`). Duplicates `chat_messages.metadata.vision` on success — the accepted price of this table answering "how many describes ran, on what, at what success rate" without joining `chat_messages` to establish a denominator. |
| `generation_id` | `TEXT?` | The join key into `engine.llm_generations` — the model that answered and its usage live there — and this row's whole record of its own call. Populated on success, and on `exhausted` when the last attempt answered but its content was unusable (`empty` / `unparseable` / `content_filter` / `blank_description` / `refusal_pattern`); NULL only when nothing ever answered — a provider status, a transport break or a timeout (`upstream_error` / `gateway_error`) — or `not_configured` (no call was made at all). |
| `attempts` | `SMALLINT` | Models actually called off `[primary, ...fallback]`; `0` when `[tasks.chat_vision]` is not configured. |
| `last_failure` | `TEXT?` | NULL when `status = "ok"` or `"not_configured"`. Values: `upstream_error` \| `gateway_error` \| `empty` \| `unparseable` \| `content_filter` \| `blank_description` \| `refusal_pattern` — the last three are `image_vision_invalidity`'s existing reason strings, reused verbatim. The first two are the v1.4.0 **pointer values** that replaced `model_error` / `timeout`; they name which of the two columns below holds the per-hop detail (see [Failed attempts](#failed-attempts-llm_attempts--gateway_errors)). |
| `llm_attempts` | `JSONB?` | Every hop where the provider answered with a failure, `task = "chat_vision"`. NULL when there were none. |
| `gateway_errors` | `JSONB?` | Every hop where our path to the provider broke. NULL when there were none. Vision failures are audited here only — they never ride the chat stream's `final` frame: the describe is a fail-open pre-stage, and an exhausted chain simply keeps the turn text-only. |
| `created_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | |

**Keeps `message_id`, deliberately breaking symmetry with
`chat_images_events`.** The two tables are not structurally alike: vision
runs *after* the `role='user'` row exists, so `message_id` is already in
hand, and there is exactly one call site with no prospect of a standalone
vision entry point. The user's accompanying text is **not** duplicated here —
`message_id` points at `chat_messages.content` for that.

Written even when the describe never ran — `not_configured`, `attempts = 0`
— because that is one of three reasons `chat_messages.metadata.vision` can be
absent on a turn, and this is the only way to tell it apart from "the
describe ran and failed on every chain model" (`exhausted`).

## Observability

`record_generation` — called from every LLM call site in the engine — logs
an `info`-level `openrouter: call completed` event carrying `generation_id`,
`model`, and best-effort parsed token/cost fields from `usage`, and persists
the same facts as a row (see [LLM generations
ledger](#llm-generations-ledger) above). `chat_companion` additionally logs a
`stream_metrics` event per attempt (`model` / `attempt` / `ttft_ms` /
`total_ms` / `outcome`) that no other task — including `chat_voice` — emits;
that log is about per-attempt stream timing, not generation identity, and
predates this table. The `audit` object itself is not logged — it is
forwarded upstream and never echoed into engine logs.

## Why not persist?

The engine's persona / chat / affinity tables are the long-lived
contract. Audit context is intentionally ephemeral so callers can
experiment with `user` hashing, metadata schemas, and per-deployment
analytics without engine-side migrations or business logic.
