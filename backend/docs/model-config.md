# Model config

[English](model-config.md) · [中文](model-config.zh.md)

LLM model selection for the engine lives in a TOML file loaded at server start. Per-task model + parameters, with optional per-tier overrides on top.

## Where it lives

- Default path: `examples/model_config.toml` (relative to the working directory). The file under `examples/` is an illustrative template — adapt it to your own needs (or point `MODEL_CONFIG_PATH` at your own file).
- Override: `MODEL_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable (single file), or `MODEL_CONFIG_DIR` (directory mode, below). The two are mutually exclusive — setting both is a boot error.
- Loaded once at server start by `eros-engine-server/src/main.rs` (`resolve_config_source` → `ModelConfig::from_toml_file` / `from_toml_dir`). For library embedders, `ModelConfig::load()` in `crates/eros-engine-llm/src/model_config.rs` does the same resolution with the same default path (`examples/model_config.toml`).
- Held as `Arc<ModelConfig>` in `AppState`; shared across all chat / post-process turns
- The server also calls `dotenvy::dotenv()` at startup, so `cp .env.example .env` works for the quickstart without an explicit `source .env`

## Directory mode

`MODEL_CONFIG_DIR` points at a directory whose `.toml` files are merged into one config at boot — for splitting a large config by section, not for layering:

- Only the directory's top level is read (no recursion); dotfiles and non-`.toml` entries are skipped. A directory with no `.toml` files is a boot error.
- Files are parsed independently and merged; load order is filename byte order (order can't change the result — duplicates are errors — it only keeps messages deterministic).
- `[defaults]` and each `[tasks.<name>]` must come from exactly one file. A section defined twice fails boot naming both files: `model_config merge failed: [tasks.chat_companion] in chat.toml already defined in base.toml`. There is no override or precedence between files.
- On success the server logs the merged file list: `model_config: loaded from dir` with the directory, filenames, and count.
- The published Docker image bakes `MODEL_CONFIG_PATH` (`docker/Dockerfile`). To use directory mode in that image, clear it alongside your dir: `-e MODEL_CONFIG_PATH= -e MODEL_CONFIG_DIR=/etc/eros/model.d` (an empty value counts as unset).

Example split:

```toml
# defaults.toml
[defaults]
fallback_model       = "x-ai/grok-4-mini"
fallback_temperature = 0.5

# chat.toml
[tasks.chat_companion]
model = "provider/chat-model"

# extraction.toml
[tasks.insight_extraction]
model = "provider/extract-model"
[tasks.memory_extraction]
model = "provider/extract-model"
```

## Schema

```toml
[defaults]
fallback_model       = "x-ai/grok-4-mini"   # used when a task has no model and no per-task fallback
fallback_temperature = 0.5
fallback_max_tokens  = 200

[tasks.<name>]
model        = "<provider>/<model-id>"      # optional — absent falls through to [defaults].fallback_model, then the compiled-in default; also accepts an array (round-robin) or table (weighted) — see "Primary model selection"
fallback     = "<provider>/<model-id>"      # optional secondary model
temperature  = 0.85                         # optional, falls back to defaults.fallback_temperature
max_tokens   = 600                          # optional, falls back to defaults.fallback_max_tokens
top_p              = 0.9                    # optional, (0.0, 1.0]  — omitted from the request when unset
frequency_penalty  = 0.4                    # optional, [-2.0, 2.0] — omitted when unset
presence_penalty   = 0.2                    # optional, [-2.0, 2.0] — omitted when unset
repetition_penalty = 1.15                   # optional, (0.0, 2.0]  — omitted when unset; 1.0 is the no-op identity
allow_traits = ["tag_a", "tag_b"]           # optional, prompt-trait allow-list (three-state)
description  = "free-form note"             # optional, documentation only — not consumed by code

# Tier sub-tables are read by `chat_companion` and `chat_output_filter` ONLY —
# see "Tier blocks are limited to two tasks" below.
[tasks.chat_companion.tiers.<tier>]
model        = "<provider>/<model-id>"      # optional, overrides task-level model for this tier
fallback     = "<provider>/<model-id>"      # optional, overrides task-level fallback for this tier
allow_traits = ["tag_a"]                    # optional, overrides task-level allow_traits for this tier
```

#### Tier blocks are limited to two tasks

Only two resolvers ever take a tier: `chat_companion`'s (the chat reply) and
`chat_output_filter`'s. Every other task resolves tier-free, so a
`[tasks.<other>.tiers.<tier>]` block could never be selected no matter what it
contains.

**The engine refuses to boot on such a block** rather than let it silently
no-op (issue #215) — the whole block, not just `filter_prompt`, since `model`,
`fallback`, `allow_traits`, `retry_depth`, `trigger` and `timing` are equally
unreachable there. The fix is to move the settings up to `[tasks.<other>]`, or
delete the block; it was never doing anything either way.

Field details:

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `defaults.fallback_model` | `String` | no | Hard fallback if the task config provides no model. If still missing, code uses the compiled-in default `x-ai/grok-4-mini`. |
| `defaults.fallback_temperature` | `f64` | no | Same precedence; compiled-in default `0.5`. |
| `defaults.fallback_max_tokens` | `u32` | no | Same precedence; compiled-in default `200`. |
| `tasks.<name>.model` | `String` \| `Array<String>` \| `Table<String,f64>` | no | Primary model. String = fixed; array = round-robin; table = weighted random. Absent (or empty) falls through to `defaults.fallback_model`, then the compiled-in default — a `[tasks.<name>]` block with no `model` key parses and boots. Exception: a present `[tasks.chat_voice]` block requires a single fixed, non-empty id and refuses to boot otherwise. See "Primary model selection". |
| `tasks.<name>.fallback` | `String` | no | Secondary model used by `OpenRouterClient` if the primary call fails. |
| `tasks.<name>.retry_depth` | `u32` | no | Truncates the resolved `fallback` chain: primary + at most this many fallbacks are ever tried. Defaults: `2` for tasks resolved by the generic `resolve()` (`chat_companion` included; per-tier override allowed), `1` for the single-purpose tasks — see "Fallback truncation (`retry_depth`)". |
| `tasks.<name>.temperature` | `f64` | no | Per-task sampling temperature. No per-tier override. |
| `tasks.<name>.max_tokens` | `u32` | no | Per-task token cap. No per-tier override. |
| `tasks.<name>.top_p` | `f32` | no | Nucleus-sampling probability mass. Valid on **every task except `embedding`**; task-level only — tiers inherit it, no per-tier override, no `[defaults]` fallback. Legal range `(0.0, 1.0]`; out of range or non-finite refuses to boot. Absent ⇒ the `top_p` wire param is omitted, not sent with a default. |
| `tasks.<name>.frequency_penalty` | `f32` | no | OpenAI-style frequency penalty. Same scoping as `top_p`. Legal range `[-2.0, 2.0]`; absent ⇒ omitted from the wire request. |
| `tasks.<name>.presence_penalty` | `f32` | no | OpenAI-style presence penalty. Same scoping as `top_p`. Legal range `[-2.0, 2.0]`; absent ⇒ omitted from the wire request. |
| `tasks.<name>.repetition_penalty` | `f32` | no | Repetition penalty — the knob for degenerate tail repetition, which `temperature` cannot address (looping is characteristic of near-greedy decoding, so lowering temperature pushes the wrong way). Same scoping as `top_p`. Legal range `(0.0, 2.0]`, `1.0` being the no-op identity; absent ⇒ omitted from the wire request. |
| `tasks.<name>.allow_traits` | `Array<String>` | no | Prompt-trait allow-list for this task (three-state: absent = no gating; `[]` = drop all traits; `["a","b"]` = whitelist). Used when no matching tier block is found. |
| `tasks.<name>.tiers.<tier>` | sub-table | no | Per-tier overrides. May set `model`, `fallback`, `allow_traits`, and/or `retry_depth`. Does not override `temperature`, `max_tokens`, `top_p`, `frequency_penalty`, `presence_penalty`, or `repetition_penalty` — all six are task-level only. **`<name>` may only be `chat_companion` or `chat_output_filter`** — every other task resolves without a tier, and a tier block under one refuses to boot (see above). |
| `tasks.chat_companion.input_filter` | `bool` \| `f64` | no | Global trigger for the user-input rewrite filter. Task-level only on `chat_companion` (no per-tier override). `false`/absent = off, `true` = every turn, `0.8` = ~80% of turns (a number outside `[0.0, 1.0]` is rejected). See "`input_filter`". |
| `tasks.<name>.description` | `String` | no | Documentation field, ignored by code. |

**`defaults.ignore_providers` and `defaults.provider_sort` are removed.** A
leftover key of either name refuses to boot with a migration message
pointing at the `[[providers.<name>.body]]` replacement — see "custom body
parameters" under `[providers]` below.

### `[providers]` — custom chat/embeddings endpoints (opt-in)

```toml
[providers]
venice = { chat = "https://api.venice.ai/api/v1/chat/completions" }
mixed  = { chat = "https://x/v1/chat/completions", embeddings = "https://x/v1/embeddings" }
local  = { embeddings = "http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/embeddings" }

[providers.proxy]           # TOML section form works too
chat    = "https://proxy.internal/v1/chat/completions"
headers = { "X-Team" = "companion", "X-Env" = "prod" }
```

Each entry is a table with up to three keys — `chat` (an OpenAI-compatible
chat-completions URL), `embeddings` (an OpenRouter-compatible embeddings
URL — see [`https://openrouter.ai/docs/api_reference/embeddings`](https://openrouter.ai/docs/api_reference/embeddings)
for the wire shape), and `headers` (sent verbatim on every request to this
entry's endpoints). **A plain-string value is rejected**: the pre-0.9.4
shape (`venice = "https://…"`) was dropped with no compatibility layer, and
the boot error names the table form. `deny_unknown_fields` applies — an
unknown key, an empty table, or an empty URL string also refuses the load.

Declares additional endpoints alongside the built-in OpenRouter client.
Reference one by suffixing a model slug anywhere a `model` / `fallback`
accepts one (any shape — fixed, round-robin, weighted) on a chat-shaped
task, or on `[tasks.embedding]`'s model fields for embeddings:

```toml
[tasks.chat_companion]
model = "venice-uncensored@venice"   # served by [providers].venice.chat
fallback = ["x-ai/grok-4.20"]        # no suffix → built-in OpenRouter

[tasks.embedding]
model = "bge-m3@local"               # served by [providers].local.embeddings
```

Rules, all enforced at boot (the engine refuses to boot on any violation):

- **Names** match `[a-z0-9_]+`. `voyage` stays reserved — its native API is
  not the OpenRouter-compatible embeddings format this mechanism speaks, and
  `$VOYAGE_API_KEY` already belongs to the built-in native Voyage client.
  `openrouter` is a valid, declarable name: it doesn't add a separate
  provider, it **overrides the built-in OpenRouter endpoint URLs** per key
  (see below).
- **URLs** are complete and posted verbatim — no path joining. A provider
  referenced from a chat-shaped task must declare `chat`; one referenced
  from `[tasks.embedding]` must declare `embeddings`. A miss on either
  refuses to boot, naming the slug, the entry, and the missing key.
- **`headers`** (optional) is a table sent verbatim on every request to this
  entry's endpoints (both `chat` and `embeddings`). `Authorization` and
  `Content-Type` are engine-owned and refuse the load if declared
  (case-insensitive) — a silently overridden `Authorization` is the worst
  kind of footgun. Every other name/value must be valid HTTP header material
  or the load refuses.
- **API key** comes from the environment as `<NAME_UPPERCASED>_API_KEY`
  (`venice` → `$VENICE_API_KEY`), one key covering both the `chat` and
  `embeddings` endpoints of that entry, required only for providers actually
  referenced by some model slug. Declared-but-unreferenced entries need no
  key. `openrouter` keeps using the existing `$OPENROUTER_API_KEY` — the
  naming convention degenerates to the var that already exists.
- **Model ids are the provider's own slugs**, sent verbatim — the engine
  never translates model names between providers.
- A literal `@` inside a model id is escaped `\@`. In a TOML double-quoted
  string that is written `"weird\\@vendor/m"`; at most one unescaped `@` per
  slug.
- **Model-keyed tables use bare ids**: `model_name_display_override`,
  `output_regex` `models`, and `output_filter` trigger `models` match on the
  id *without* `@provider`.
- **Wire shape**: custom providers receive a strict OpenAI-compatible
  subset. Per-task `reasoning` is **inert** on custom providers — they
  receive exactly this entry's own declared `headers` and any
  `[[providers.<name>.body]]` rules declared on that same entry (see
  below), never the OpenRouter attribution headers.
- **Audit**: rows served by a custom provider record
  `model = "<upstream echo>@<name>"` and the provider's own `generation_id`
  verbatim — a `generation_id` join against OpenRouter's logs misses for
  those rows, and the `model` column says why.
- Under `MODEL_CONFIG_DIR`, `[providers]` merges as one whole top-level key
  (like `[defaults]`, unlike `[tasks]`): all providers live in one file.

#### Built-in endpoint overrides via `[providers].openrouter`

```toml
[providers.openrouter]
embeddings = "http://my-proxy/v1/embeddings"
headers    = { "HTTP-Referer" = "https://eros.example", "X-OpenRouter-Title" = "Eros" }
```

- Each present key (`chat` and/or `embeddings`) overrides that built-in URL;
  each absent key keeps the built-in default
  (`https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions` /
  `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/embeddings`). This partial-override rule is
  unique to `openrouter` — for ordinary entries a missing key is a boot
  error when referenced, because there is no built-in default to fall back
  to.
- The override changes the URL **only**. Traffic through it remains the
  full OpenRouter wire: per-task `reasoning` is still sent, and any
  `[[providers.openrouter.body]]` rules (see below) merge into the request
  body — unlike custom providers, which keep receiving the strict OpenAI
  subset with `reasoning` inert.
- **Attribution headers now live here, and nowhere else.** No
  `[providers.openrouter]` entry, or one without `headers`, means no
  attribution headers are sent. The `OPENROUTER_APP_REFERER` /
  `OPENROUTER_APP_TITLE` / `OPENROUTER_APP_CATEGORIES` env vars are
  **soft-deprecated**: a still-set value is silently ignored, never a boot
  error — re-declare the same headers under `[providers].openrouter.headers`
  instead (see [`llm-audit.md`](llm-audit.md) for the header/purpose
  mapping).
- The API key stays `$OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.
- **`OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` no longer exists as an env var.** The only
  override mechanism is `[providers].openrouter.chat` /
  `[providers].openrouter.embeddings`. A still-set `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` is
  not read and causes no boot error — it's just an unrelated env var now.
- `voyage` remains undeclarable in `[providers]` (see above).

#### `[[providers.<name>.body]]` — custom body parameters

Deployer-defined JSON merged into the chat/completions request body, per
task. `params` is passed through verbatim (TOML → JSON) — the engine never
interprets it. `tasks` scopes the rule to specific engine task names
(exact, case-sensitive; see the task table below); omit it to apply to
every task this provider serves. Rules apply in declaration order,
later rules win on key conflicts, and merged params win over engine-built
fields — declaring `reasoning` on the `openrouter` entry therefore
overrides `[tasks.*].reasoning` for the scoped tasks. This is not special to
`reasoning`: **every** engine-built wire field loses to a body param —
`temperature`, `max_tokens`, and the four sampling knobs (`top_p`,
`frequency_penalty`, `presence_penalty`, `repetition_penalty`) included.
`model`, `messages`,
and `stream` are engine-owned and refuse to boot. A rule naming `embedding`
warns and never applies (that call builds its own body and takes no
chat-shaped parameters). Custom providers must declare `chat` to use body
rules; the reserved `openrouter` entry may declare rules alone.

**Upgrade hazard: `tasks` matches by exact string, not by chain.** The human
chain used to report a single wire task name (`insight_extraction`) for both
its stages; since the structuring split it reports `insight_extraction` for
stage 1 and `insight_structuring` for stage 2 (see the task table below). A
rule written before the split — `tasks = ["insight_extraction"]` — now scopes
to stage 1 only. It silently stops applying to stage 2: there is no boot
warning, because `insight_structuring` is a known task name, just not the one
your rule lists. If a rule is meant to cover both stages of the human chain,
list both: `tasks = ["insight_extraction", "insight_structuring"]`.

Weigh the trade-off before reaching for a body rule instead of the task
block: rules are **provider-scoped** while a `fallback` chain crosses
providers, so a task whose primary and fallback live on different
`[providers]` entries needs the same param declared twice and the two can
silently diverge; and `params` is unschema'd passthrough, so a misspelled key
is never caught. Prefer `[tasks.<name>]` for anything it can express, and keep
body rules for what it cannot (vendor-specific fields, OpenRouter routing
prefs).

```toml
[providers.venice]
chat = "https://api.venice.ai/api/v1/chat/completions"

[[providers.venice.body]]
tasks  = ["chat_companion", "chat_output_filter"]
params = { venice_parameters = { include_venice_system_prompt = false } }

[[providers.openrouter.body]]
params = { provider = { ignore = ["some-bad-provider"], sort = "price" } }
```

The second example is the replacement for the removed
`[defaults].ignore_providers` / `[defaults].provider_sort` keys: OpenRouter
routing prefs are now ordinary body params (bare OpenRouter provider slugs,
no `@openrouter` suffix), scopable per task like any other rule. The old
keys refuse to boot with this migration message. The removed keys also fed
the `chat_vision` body; since body rules now cover vision too, an
untargeted rule like the one above reaches the vision call as well — scope
it with `tasks` if you want routing prefs on chat only.

`chat_vision` is covered even though it is not a chat/completions task: its
describe call builds its own body, but that body runs through the same
merge, so a knob the `reasoning` object cannot express still reaches the
vision pre-stage.

```toml
[[providers.openrouter.body]]
tasks  = ["chat_vision"]
params = { reasoning_effort = "none" }
```

This matters because some models ignore `reasoning = { enabled = false }`,
reason anyway, and bill for it — and `reasoning_effort` is a separate
top-level field, not part of the `reasoning` object, so `[tasks.*].reasoning`
cannot express it. Vision's `messages` is a block array (text +
`image_url`) rather than the chat shape, but `messages` is engine-owned and
refused at boot, so no rule can flatten it.

### `model_name_display_override` (chat task only)

Controls the `model` value sent to clients in chat SSE `meta` frames. Affects
**only** the client display — never the OpenRouter request, the persisted
assistant row, or usage logging. Task-level on `[tasks.chat_companion]`; every
tier inherits it. Setting it on other tasks parses but has no effect.

| Form | Example | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `false` *(default when absent)* | `false` | `model` is **omitted** from the frame |
| `true` | `true` | the real model id is sent (pre-0.x behavior) |
| string | `"Aria"` | always sends `"Aria"` |
| array | `["Aria","Nova"]` | random pick per bubble (re-randomizes on replay) |
| map | `{ "deepseek/x" = "Aria", default = "Companion" }` | maps the real id to a name; `default` when unlisted; omit if no `default` |

Because the display name is never persisted, the **array** form re-randomizes on
history replay; `bool`/`string`/`map` are deterministic.

### `output_filter` — second-pass reply rewrite (chat task only)

Passes the completed chat reply through a second LLM before the client sees it. The
filter is **off by default** and has no effect unless explicitly enabled.

#### Turning the filter on

`output_filter` is a boolean flag on `[tasks.chat_companion]`. It acts as a
task-level default, which any tier sub-table may override:

```toml
[tasks.chat_companion]
output_filter = true              # task-level default; applies when no matching tier block exists

[tasks.chat_companion.tiers.gold]
output_filter = true              # per-tier override; takes precedence over the task default
```

Resolution follows the same precedence as every other `chat_companion` field:

```
matched tier block > task default block
```

The compiled-in default when neither sets `output_filter` is `false`.

#### Gating rules

The filter runs for a given turn only when **all** of the following hold:

1. `output_filter` resolves to `true` for the active tier (per the precedence above).
2. `[tasks.chat_output_filter]` is present in the config.
3. The resolved `filter_prompt` for the active tier is non-blank.
4. Any `trigger` predicates that are present all pass (see below).

If any condition is unmet the filter is **inert** — the original reply is delivered unchanged.

#### `[tasks.chat_output_filter]` fields

```toml
[tasks.chat_output_filter]
model        = "openai/gpt-5.4-nano"
fallback     = ["google/gemini-3.1-flash", "zhipuai/zlm-4.7-flash"]
retry_depth  = 1     # fallbacks to try on filter failure (default 1 = primary + first fallback)
temperature  = 0.3
max_tokens   = 400
filter_prompt = """
Rewrite the assistant reply below per <your policy>. Output only the rewrite.
"""
# trigger: AND of the predicates you specify; omit all ⇒ filter every turn.
trigger      = { random = 0.3, models = ["x/y"], traits = { any = ["nsfw_boost"], when = "present" } }
timing       = "after_extract"   # or "before_extract"

[tasks.chat_output_filter.tiers.gold]
filter_prompt = "..."            # any field is optional; falls back to the default block
```

**Recommended models for `chat_output_filter`:**

- **Primary**: `openai/gpt-5.4-nano` — fast, stable filtered output.
- **DO NOT** use `openai/gpt-4.1-nano` as the filter model — empirically returns `"对不起，无法满足你的要求"`-style refusals with HTTP 200, which the engine cannot distinguish from a successful filtered rewrite, so the fail-open path never triggers and the user sees the refusal text.
- **Recommended fallback**: `google/gemini-3.1-flash` — high success rate; when it does fail it surfaces a proper error response (non-200), letting the engine's fail-open path kick in and emit the original reply.
- **Cost-saving fallback**: `zhipuai/zlm-4.7-flash` — cheaper, similar fail-mode profile to gemini-3.1-flash.
- **DO NOT** use `anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5` for the filter — its input tolerance for NSFW (great for extraction) does NOT extend to output; the safety alignment on the output side is strict enough that the filter LLM often refuses to produce rewritten text at all.

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `model` | `String` \| `Array` \| `Table` | — | Primary filter model. Accepts the same three shapes as `chat_companion.model`. |
| `fallback` | `String` \| `Array<String>` | — | Fallback chain for the filter call. |
| `retry_depth` | `u32` | `1` | Number of `fallback` entries the filter may try before giving up. `0` = primary only; `1` = primary + first fallback (default). |
| `temperature` | `f64` | `defaults.fallback_temperature` | Sampling temperature for the filter model. **Task-level only — no per-tier override** (same as every other task). |
| `max_tokens` | `u32` | `defaults.fallback_max_tokens` | Token cap for the filter response. **Task-level only — no per-tier override.** |
| `top_p` | `f32` | absent | Nucleus sampling, `(0.0, 1.0]`. Omitted from the request when unset. |
| `frequency_penalty` | `f32` | absent | OpenAI-style frequency penalty, `[-2.0, 2.0]`. Omitted when unset. |
| `presence_penalty` | `f32` | absent | OpenAI-style presence penalty, `[-2.0, 2.0]`. Omitted when unset. |
| `repetition_penalty` | `f32` | absent | Repetition penalty, `(0.0, 2.0]` (`1.0` = no-op). Omitted when unset. |
| `filter_prompt` | `String` | — | **Required for the filter to be active.** System/instruction prompt sent to the filter model. Blank or absent → filter is inert. |
| `trigger` | inline table | absent (every turn) | AND-gate on when to apply the filter. Omit the whole key to filter every qualifying turn. |
| `timing` | `"after_extract"` \| `"before_extract"` | `"after_extract"` | Controls whether extract (memory/insight/affinity) reads the original or the filtered text (see below). |

Per-tier sub-tables (`[tasks.chat_output_filter.tiers.<tier>]`) may override
`model`, `fallback`, `retry_depth`, `filter_prompt`, `trigger`, and `timing`; a
tier that omits one falls back to the default `[tasks.chat_output_filter]` block.
**`temperature`, `max_tokens`, and the four sampling knobs are task-level only**
(per-tier sub-tables do not override them — the same rule as every other task).

#### `trigger` predicates

`trigger` is an optional inline table. Every predicate you include must pass; predicates you omit are treated as passing. Omit `trigger` entirely to filter every qualifying turn.

| Predicate | Type | Semantics |
|---|---|---|
| `random` | `f64` in `(0.0, 1.0]` | Probability that this turn passes. `random = 0.3` → ~30 % of turns are filtered. Unlike `input_filter`, this range is **not validated at boot**: the per-turn draw is uniform in `[0.0, 1.0)`, so `random ≥ 1.0` always fires and `random ≤ 0.0` never fires — no load-time or runtime error either way. |
| `models` | `Array<String>` | Turn passes only if the producing model id is in the list. |
| `traits` | `{ any = [...], when = "present" \| "absent" }` | Turn passes only if at least one tag in `any` is present (`when = "present"`) or absent (`when = "absent"`) among the tags **actually injected** into the prompt — i.e. after tier `allow_traits` gating, the same set reported in the `final` frame's `prompt_injected`. A trait the tier dropped does not count as present. |

#### `timing` and extract behavior

| `timing` | Extract input | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `"after_extract"` *(default)* | Original (pre-filter) text | Memory/insight/affinity see the unmodified reply; only the rewritten text is delivered to the client and persisted in `chat_messages`. |
| `"before_extract"` | Filtered text | Extract also reads the rewritten text. Use this when the filter normalizes content that the extract pipeline should reflect. |

**Fail-open:** if the filter LLM call times out or returns an error the engine delivers the **original** reply unchanged (the filter never blocks the chat response).

#### What is stored / shown

Only the **filtered** text is written to `chat_messages` and shown to the client. The original text is used internally for extract when `timing = "after_extract"` (default) and is then discarded. History replay therefore shows the filtered version.

#### SSE `final`-frame fields

The `final` event emitted at the end of a chat SSE stream includes several new
fields. These are independent of whether the filter ran — all are always present
when the frame is emitted.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `filtered` | `bool` | `true` if the client received non-raw output this turn — set by the regex strip (`output_regex`), the LLM `output_filter`, or both; `false` otherwise. |
| `retries_chat` | `u32` | Number of fallback retries consumed by the chat model call (0 = primary succeeded). |
| `retries_filter` | `u32` | Number of fallback retries consumed by the filter model call (0 = primary succeeded or filter did not run). |
| `prompt_injected` | `Array<String>` \| `null` | Trait tags that were injected into the prompt this turn, or `null` if none. Independent of the filter. |
| `tier` | `String` \| `null` | Echo of the `tier` field from the request, or `null` if none was sent. Independent of the filter. |

### `output_regex` — deterministic per-model regex strip (chat task only)

`output_regex` is an array of strip rules on `[tasks.chat_companion]` (task-level
only — no per-tier override). Each rule deletes or replaces regex matches in the
assistant reply produced by any model in `models`. It is **off by default** (absent
or empty array means no stripping).

```toml
[tasks.chat_companion]
output_regex = [
  # Strip L3.3-Euryale's self-narrated photo line on reply_text_image turns.
  { models = ["sao10k/l3.3-euryale-70b"],
    pattern = '\s*\[你给对方发送了一张照片[：:][^\]]*\]\s*$' },
  # Replace matches instead of deleting (replacement defaults to "" = delete):
  # { models = ["x/y"], pattern = '...', replacement = "…" },
]
```

#### Rule shape

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `models` | `Array<String>` | yes | Model ids whose replies this rule applies to. Exact string match against the chat model id that produced the reply — i.e. the row's `model` column, NOT `filter_model` (which is set to `"<regex>"` when a strip fires). |
| `pattern` | `String` | yes | Rust `regex` crate pattern. **No lookaround or backreferences** — anchor with `$`, `^`, `\s*`, char classes. An invalid pattern causes server boot to fail. |
| `replacement` | `String` | no | Text to substitute for each match. Absent or `""` = delete the match. |

Rules are checked in declaration order; all matching rules are applied sequentially
to the same reply.

#### Execution order — layer 0

The regex strip runs **before** any other processing:

1. Regex strip (layer 0) — applied first, before the client sees anything
2. LLM `output_filter` (if enabled) — second pass
3. Memory / insight / affinity extraction — reads the already-stripped text

The matched text therefore reaches **neither** the client **nor** the stored
`content` **nor** the extract pipeline — regardless of `timing` on
`[tasks.chat_output_filter]`.

#### Audit columns

| Column | Value when strip fires |
|---|---|
| `pre_filter_content` | The raw (pre-strip) reply |
| `filter_model` | `"<regex>"` |

These columns are set only when at least one rule actually changes the reply (same
as the LLM filter — a no-op strip leaves them null).

#### Artifact-only reply ⇒ empty bubble

When the reply is **entirely** an artifact (e.g. a bare
`[你给对方发送了一张照片：…]` with nothing else), the strip empties it. There is
**no fail-safe**: the client receives **no content bubble** (no delta is sent),
the row persists empty `content` (`""`), and the audit columns are still set
(`pre_filter_content` = the raw reply, `filter_model` = `"<regex>"`). The
downstream client decides how to render an empty/NULL reply — the reference web
client simply doesn't show it, which reads as a ghost-like non-reply and tends
to make the user follow up (closer to chatting with a real person).

#### `filtered` flag

The SSE `final`-frame `filtered` field is `true` when the client received non-raw
output from **either** the regex strip **or** the LLM `output_filter` (or both).

### `input_filter` — user-input rewrite (chat task only)

`input_filter` is a trigger on `[tasks.chat_companion]` (default `false`,
task-level only — no per-tier override). It accepts a **bool or a probability**:
`false` = off, `true` = every turn (= `1.0`), `0.8` = a per-turn coin flip that
fires on ~80% of turns. A number outside `[0.0, 1.0]` (or non-finite) is rejected
at config-load time. When it fires for a user **Reply** turn, that turn is passed
to a second LLM (`[tasks.chat_input_filter]`) BEFORE generation. The filter
returns a JSON verdict:

- `{"rewrite": false}` — the input is meaningful; the engine uses it verbatim.
- `{"rewrite": true, "content": "…", "reason": "…"}` — the input was meaningless
  (e.g. `1111`, `？？？`, key-mashing); the engine uses `content` instead.

The user's **original** text is always persisted as `content` and shown to the
client. A rewrite is stored in `pre_filter_content` (model-facing only),
`filter_model`, `f_generation_id`, and `filter_triggers = {"reason": …}`. The
model and memory recall see the effective text (`pre_filter_content ?? content`)
for user rows; extraction (insight/memory/affinity) keeps reading the original.

The filter runs only when `input_filter` fires (`true`, or the per-turn draw
passes its probability) AND `[tasks.chat_input_filter]` exists with a non-blank
`filter_prompt`. It is **fail-open**: any error, timeout, unparseable verdict, or
refusal leaves the original input untouched. Pick a fast, cheap model — at
`input_filter = true` it runs on every user turn before generation.

#### `[tasks.chat_input_filter]` fields

Reuses the standard task shape: `model`, `fallback`, `retry_depth` (default 1),
`temperature`, `max_tokens`, `filter_prompt`, `reasoning` (default off in the
example). `trigger`, `timing`, `tiers`, and `allow_traits` are ignored (the
input filter has no triggers, timing, or tiers).

## Task names

Absent block ⇒ stage 2 resolves on stage 1's model/budget, never the global default) | live |

| `chat_image_prompt_compose` | `pipeline::stream` (image-prompt composer; **required for image turns** — the PDE judge writes no seed, so without this task the engine reports 可发图=否 and downgrades image actions.

| `affinity_evaluation` | `pipeline::post_process` (per-turn affinity verdict — four graded line axes plus two absolute 1..3 endpoint levels, converted engine-side; runs after each Reply turn, fire-and-forget; **takes no `filter_prompt`** — the prompt is engine-owned and setting the key refuses to boot — **in any form, an explicit blank included**. Unlike every other task here, blank does not mean "off", so omit the key entirely. See issue #210) | live |
| `affinity_summary` | `pipeline::post_process::summarize_feeling` (rewrites `companion_affinity.feeling_clause` — the `[feelings]` block's first-person narrative — from band labels and recent judge reasons; runs after the affinity write, movement turns only (any judge grade, an endpoint level off baseline, or a ghost) and only when the request actually injects an affinity axis; request-scoped and billed to the turn's user, not a sweeper. **Takes no `filter_prompt`** — the prompt is engine-owned, same policy as `affinity_evaluation`, and setting the key refuses to boot. Block absent ⇒ `feeling_clause` stays `NULL` and `[feelings]` never renders) | live (opt-in) |
| `character_insight_extraction` | `pipeline::post_process` (stage 1 of the character chain — experimental, EXPERIMENTAL — per-turn fact miner for the AI **character**, the mirror of `insight_extraction`'s human-side mining.

Absent block ⇒ stage 2 resolves on stage 1's model/budget, never the global default) | experimental (opt-in) |
| `user_insight_extraction` | `pipeline::post_process` (stage 1 of the user chain — experimental — per-turn fact miner for the real **user**, but scoped to one relationship rather than the global `insight_extraction`.

| `chat_input_filter` | `pipeline::stream` (user-input rewrite filter; activated by `input_filter` on `[tasks.chat_companion]` and this task block; off by default) | live (opt-in) |
| `chat_voice` | `pipeline::voice::run_voice_turn`, reached from `routes::voice` (`POST /comp/voice/{session_id}/turn/stream`) via `resolve_voice()` (voice-channel companion reply; a blank `filter_prompt` does NOT disable it — falls back to the built-in directive; off when the task block is absent) | live (opt-in) |
| `world_director` | `pipeline::world::sweeper` via `resolve_world_director()` (background per-owner world-state director round; off when the task block is absent/blank, `WORLD_DISABLED` is set, or `WORLD_TICK_SECS=0`) | live (opt-in) |
| `world_stories_director` | `pipeline::story::run_stories_scan`, invoked from `pipeline::world::sweeper` via `resolve_world_stories_director()` (per-owner story round, gated on `world_director` also being configured; off when the task block is absent/blank or `WORLD_STORIES_DISABLED` is set) | live (opt-in) |
| `world_comment` | `pipeline::world_town::sweeper` via `resolve_world_comment()` (hourly world-town comment round, gated on `world_director` also being configured — posts only exist downstream of it; off when the task block is absent/blank, `WORLD_DISABLED` or `WORLD_TOWN_DISABLED` is set, or `WORLD_TICK_SECS=0`) | live (opt-in) |
| `world_reply` | `pipeline::world_town::sweeper` via `resolve_world_reply()` (debounced/cooldown/capped responder reply to user comments on world-town posts, gated on `world_director` also being configured; off when the task block is absent/blank, `WORLD_DISABLED` or `WORLD_TOWN_DISABLED` is set, or `WORLD_TICK_SECS=0`) | live (opt-in) |
| `embedding` | `EmbeddingRouter::from_config()` at boot (`main.rs`), via `ModelConfig::resolve_embedding()` — routes `embed_query`/`embed_document`/`embed_documents` to native Voyage, the built-in OpenRouter embeddings endpoint, or a custom `[providers]` entry; absent block = native Voyage `voyage-4-lite` | live |

A `[tasks.<name>]` entry is only meaningful if the engine actually calls `model_config.resolve("<name>", ...)` somewhere. The current call sites are:

- `crates/eros-engine-server/src/pipeline/handlers.rs` → `chat_companion`, `chat_output_filter`
- `crates/eros-engine-server/src/pipeline/post_process.rs` → `insight_extraction`, `insight_structuring`, `affinity_evaluation`, `affinity_summary`, `character_insight_extraction`, `character_insight_structuring`, `user_insight_extraction`, `user_insight_structuring`
- `crates/eros-engine-server/src/pipeline/stream.rs` → `pde_decision` via `run_pde_decision` inside `run_stream` (only when `filter_prompt` is set); `chat_image_prompt_compose` via `resolve_image_prompt_compose()` (image-prompt composer, required for image turns, resolved lazily only on image turns); `chat_vision` via `resolve_vision()` (vision pre-stage, opt-in); `chat_product_qa` via `resolve_product_qa()` (product-QA executor, opt-in); `chat_input_filter` via `resolve_input_filter()` (input rewrite, opt-in); `memory_extraction` via the dreaming sweeper
- `crates/eros-engine-server/src/routes/image_edit.rs` → `chat_image_edit_compose` via `resolve_image_edit_compose()` (image-EDIT composer, resolved on every request to the edit endpoint; falls back to `[tasks.chat_image_prompt_compose]`'s chain when the edit block is absent — see below)

`embedding` doesn't go through the generic `resolve()` path above — it has
its own resolver, `ModelConfig::resolve_embedding()`, called once at boot
from `main.rs` to build the `EmbeddingRouter`. See "`[tasks.embedding]` —
active" below.

### `[tasks.chat_voice]` — voice-channel companion reply (opt-in)

Powers `POST /comp/voice/{session_id}/turn/stream`
(`pipeline::voice::run_voice_turn`, reached from `routes::voice` via
`resolve_voice()`). Off unless this task block exists.

- `model` — **must** be a single fixed, non-empty id. Unlike every other
  task, the round-robin array, the weighted table, and `tiers` all refuse to
  boot on `chat_voice` (mixing models mid-call isn't supported). `fallback`
  is still allowed as a sequential outage-retry chain.
- `filter_prompt` — optional voice directive override. Unlike
  `chat_vision`/`chat_product_qa`, a blank or absent value does **not**
  disable the feature — it falls back to the built-in directive (short,
  spoken, no markdown/emoji/bracketed stage directions).
- `tts_audio_tags` (bool, default `false`) — when `true`, the effective
  directive invites inline audio tags (`[laughs]`, `[whispers]`, …) that
  Gemini-family TTS models render as delivery cues. Tags pass through
  verbatim (streamed, persisted, replayed); the client must feed the text to
  a TTS model that understands them. Composes with a custom `filter_prompt`
  — the tag guidance is appended to it.
- `recall` (bool, default `true`) — per-turn read-only vector recall on the
  voice path. `false` keeps the voice prompt recall-free on every turn
  regardless of the request's `memory_scope` — config always wins over the
  per-request scope. See
  [memory-layers.md](memory-layers.md#voice-turns).

Call site: `crates/eros-engine-server/src/pipeline/voice.rs::run_voice_turn`.

### `[tasks.pde_decision]` — opt-in LLM PDE judge

By default the engine uses the built-in rule engine (`eros-engine-core/src/pde.rs`) to decide the per-turn action (reply / ghost / proactive). Setting `filter_prompt` in this block switches on an LLM judge:

- The LLM receives the recent conversation, the engine-computed relationship buckets (`[亲密度] 当前档位=第 N 档` and `[耐心] 当前档位=高/中/低` — never raw affinity numbers), and conversation signals, and returns a JSON verdict with:
  - `action`: `"reply_text"` | `"ghost"` | `"reply_image"` | `"reply_text_image"` | `"product_qa"` (image variants are available when the request includes an `image` block AND `[tasks.chat_image_prompt_compose]` is configured — both must hold, since the judge itself writes no image prompt; otherwise they degrade to `reply_text`. The chat stream never draws — it emits an `image_request` frame and the consumer calls its own image vendor. `product_qa` is available only when `[tasks.chat_product_qa]` is fully enabled — see below; unavailable proposals degrade to `reply_text`, never upgrade.)
  - `inner_state`: a short mood/tone description folded into the reply prompt
  - `tone` (optional): a short delivery directive for this turn's reply — injected into the reply prompt as a `[reply_tone]` section on text-bearing actions; omitted when absent
  - `reason`: optional
- **Fail-open:** any LLM timeout or error falls back to the rule engine — the LLM judge never blocks a chat response.
- **Hard-safety guardrails** (enforced after the LLM verdict, before the rule-engine fallback): never ghost in the first 10 messages, never ghost a third time in a row (`ghost_streak ≥ 2` vetoes; two consecutive are allowed), one-hour ghost cooldown.
- Every judge call is audited to `companion_decision_events`: `payload` is what the model returned; `inputs` (JSONB, migration `0044`) freezes the engine-computed state the judge was shown — intimacy rung, patience band, bond/chemistry, and the six raw axes. Written fire-and-forget; historical rows stay `NULL`.

**Image-availability context line.** The judge context always carries exactly one line — `[图片能力] 本轮可发图=是` when an image action is available this turn (the request carries an `image` block AND `[tasks.chat_image_prompt_compose]` is configured — both must hold), or `[图片能力] 本轮可发图=否` otherwise. Prompt authors should treat `本轮可发图=否` as a hard constraint (never choose `reply_image` / `reply_text_image` — they would be degraded by `guard_action` anyway, wasting tokens and skewing audits), and `本轮可发图=是` as the gate that *permits* image actions, then decide by persona/context (the engine does not force an image just because one is possible). Keep the token string `[图片能力] 本轮可发图=是/否` verbatim if a downstream overlay references it.

**Recent-image context line.** The judge context also always carries exactly one
`[近期图片] 最近8条消息内已发图=<n> 张；上一条 AI 消息是图片=<是/否>（以本行计数为准，对话记录里的图片标记仅供参考）`
line. The engine counts these from the stored rows so the judge never has to
tally image markers in the transcript itself — the parenthetical tells the model
to trust this line over its own counting. The window is the last **8 rows**, not
8 turns. Prompt authors writing a custom `filter_prompt` receive this line
whether or not they reference it; keep the token string verbatim if a downstream
overlay parses it.

**`structured_output` field** (bool, default `true`): sends the judge call with a
`response_format` JSON-schema constraint. Set `structured_output = false` if your
provider or model rejects that parameter (some return HTTP 400) — the engine then
asks for JSON in the prompt alone and parses the reply the same way. Also
available on `[tasks.world_director]`, `[tasks.world_stories_director]`, and
`[tasks.world_comment]`, with the same default.

**`ghosting` field** (bool, default `true`): a safety switch for downstream products. Set `ghosting = false` to disable ghosting across the _entire_ PDE path — LLM verdict, rule fallback, and the pure rule engine — so the companion never goes silent. Useful for products where silent turns are undesirable.

### `[tasks.chat_image_prompt_compose]` — image-prompt composer (required for image turns)

The PDE judge no longer writes an image-prompt seed — it only decides the
action, `inner_state`, and (on an image action) the reference/aspect-ratio
inputs. Producing the actual image prompt is entirely this task's job: when an
image action is decided, the engine runs the composer **after** the decision
and **before** generation, feeding it the persona appearance, the recent
scene, the partner's latest message, the chosen style, and the target aspect
ratio. The composer **generates** the prompt from that context — it does not
expand a seed, because none exists anymore.

**This task is now REQUIRED for image turns.** Without
`[tasks.chat_image_prompt_compose]` configured, the engine has no way to
produce an image prompt at all: it reports `本轮可发图=否` (image capability
false) to the judge and downgrades any `reply_image` / `reply_text_image`
proposal to `reply_text`. Configure this block to make image turns possible.

**Wire contract.** The composer must reply with JSON carrying exactly two
fields:

```json
{"prompt": "<image-generation prompt>", "caption": "<one short line>"}
```

`prompt` is the image subject the engine uses for generation. `caption` is a
short, natural-language line describing the picture — it is what gets
persisted to `metadata.image.caption` and is the only thing the chat history
and the judge transcript ever read back; the long `prompt` is never injected
into either. A reply that fails to parse as JSON (or as a JSON block embedded
in prose) is used **as the prompt, with no caption** — so an old EXPAND-era
`filter_prompt`, written for the pre-#212 seed-expansion contract, still
produces images (degraded: no caption, and a prompt written to expand a seed
that is now always empty). Rewrite it to the contract above to get captions
back.

The feature is **fail-open**: on composer failure / timeout / empty reply the
engine falls back to an empty subject — `compose_image_prompt` turns that into
a plain persona-appearance portrait prompt — so a broken composer degrades
image quality rather than blocking or failing the image turn. The task is
resolved **lazily, only on image turns**, so it never advances a `model`
round-robin cursor on text/ghost turns.

**Two consumers, one contract.** Besides the chat stream's image turns, the
standalone `POST /persona/{instance_id}/image/compose` endpoint (see
[api-reference.md](api-reference.md)) runs this same task with the same
five-slot payload (`[人物外观] / [最近场景] / [对方最新消息] / [风格] / [画幅]`)
and the same `filter_prompt` contract — a deployment's custom prompt needs no
changes to serve both. Two behavioural differences on the endpoint side: the
`[最近场景]` slot is filled from the request's `scene` field instead of the
conversation history, and there is **no portrait fallback** — a fully failed
chain is an HTTP error carrying the provider's own status (the endpoint doubles
as the composer's test surface, so it reports failure instead of masking it).

```toml
[tasks.chat_image_prompt_compose]
model        = "x-ai/grok-4"                       # any text model; pick one comfortable with your content range
fallback     = ["google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite"]
retry_depth  = 1
temperature  = 0.7
max_tokens   = 700
# reasoning  = { enabled = false }
# filter_prompt is OPTIONAL — omit to use the built-in default (below):
# filter_prompt = """…override…"""
```

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `model` | `ModelSpec` (string \| array \| table) | absent | Composer model (same three shapes as `chat_companion.model`). |
| `fallback` | `String` \| `Array<String>` | `[]` | Sequential retry chain (FallbackSpec), truncated to `retry_depth`. |
| `retry_depth` | `u32` | `1` | Primary + this many fallbacks. |
| `temperature` | `f64` | task default | Sampling temperature for the composer call. |
| `max_tokens` | `u32` | task default | Token cap for the composer call. |
| `top_p` | `f32` | absent | Nucleus sampling, `(0.0, 1.0]`. Omitted from the request when unset. |
| `frequency_penalty` | `f32` | absent | OpenAI-style frequency penalty, `[-2.0, 2.0]`. Omitted when unset. |
| `presence_penalty` | `f32` | absent | OpenAI-style presence penalty, `[-2.0, 2.0]`. Omitted when unset. |
| `repetition_penalty` | `f32` | absent | Repetition penalty, `(0.0, 2.0]` (`1.0` = no-op). Omitted when unset. |
| `reasoning` | table | absent | Optional reasoning control forwarded to OpenRouter. |
| `filter_prompt` | `String` \| `Array<String>` \| `Table<String, String>` | **built-in default** | **Optional** (unlike other tasks). Blank/absent ⇒ the engine's built-in `DEFAULT_COMPOSE_PROMPT`. See **variants** below for the array/table shapes. |

**Built-in default prompt.** Unlike every other task (whose prompt must come from
config), the composer ships a generic, **product-identity-free** built-in
default. It **generates** the prompt and caption straight from context —
persona appearance, recent scene, the partner's latest message, style, aspect
ratio — and does **not** soften, downgrade, censor, or refuse, and adds no
content-moderation layer of its own — moderation is delegated to the
image-model provider and the downstream deployment, not this step. A
non-blank `filter_prompt` overrides it (and must honor the JSON contract
above); a blank/absent one falls back to it.

**Variants.** This task's `filter_prompt` accepts more than a plain string (so
does `[tasks.chat_image_edit_compose]`'s — see below). The consumer picks one
per chat turn via `image.prompt_variant` on the send-message body. Three
shapes:

```toml
filter_prompt = "…"                       # one prompt; prompt_variant is ignored
filter_prompt = ["…", "…"]                # pick by index: prompt_variant = "0" / "1"
filter_prompt = { a = "…", b = "…" }      # pick by key:   prompt_variant = "a" / "b"
```

Composer prompts tend to be long, multi-paragraph strings, and TOML 1.0.0
discourages breaking an inline table across lines — so the keyed form also
works as a standard (non-inline) table, one key per section:

```toml
[tasks.chat_image_prompt_compose.filter_prompt]
a = """
…long prompt…
"""
b = """
…another long prompt…
"""
```

Anything not selected falls back to the **built-in** prompt above, never to
"first entry wins" — but the two ways of "not selected" are logged
differently. An **absent** `prompt_variant` falls back silently (the common
case: no variant was requested, so there is nothing to warn about). An
**explicitly-supplied** variant that fails to match — an out-of-range index, an
unknown key — also falls back, but additionally logs at `warn`, since a
variant the caller asked for and didn't get is worth surfacing. There is no
reserved `default` key: writing `default = "…"` defines an ordinary variant,
selected only by a literal `prompt_variant = "default"`.

`prompt_variant = "raw"` carries **no special meaning**. It is an ordinary
variant name like any other: it selects a prompt only if this deployment
configures a variant under that literal key (any casing), and an unknown
index or key — `"raw"` included, if unconfigured — falls back to the built-in
prompt above like any other miss, never an error. `raw` is not reserved: a
table key literally named `raw` boots fine.

Variants are honored on this task and `[tasks.chat_image_edit_compose]` only.
An array/table `filter_prompt` on any other task refuses to boot rather than
sit there unreachable. This task's own
`[tasks.chat_image_prompt_compose.tiers.*]` blocks refuse to boot in **any**
shape — the composer always resolves with no tier, so the whole block is
unreachable (see "Tier blocks are limited to two tasks" above).

Call site: `crates/eros-engine-server/src/pipeline/stream.rs` via
`resolve_image_prompt_compose()` in `model_config.rs`.

**Audit.** A successful composer call — including the non-JSON fallback path
above, which still counts as success — writes three keys into the image
turn's `chat_messages.metadata.image`: `compose_variant` (which
`filter_prompt` key/index was selected; absent for a plain/built-in
prompt; recorded as supplied (trimmed), not normalized — e.g. for the
indexed shape, `"01"` selects index 1 and is audited as `"01"`),
`compose_model` (the model that answered), and
`compose_generation_id`. All three are absent only when the composer call
itself failed (fail-open degradation) or the task isn't configured — same
NULL semantics as the affinity audit trio (`raw` carries no special meaning
anymore, so it is not a distinct case here). The composer's `caption` is
persisted separately as `metadata.image.caption`: set whenever the reply
parsed as JSON with a non-blank `caption` field, and `None` otherwise —
including on a successful-but-non-JSON reply, where the whole reply becomes
`prompt` with no caption. `metadata.image.prompt` — the composer's `prompt`
field, the actual image-generation subject — **is** persisted on every image
turn; it's the field `build_delegated_image_marker` writes and the audit
trio above rides alongside.

**Every composer call — success or failure, from any caller — is separately
recorded in `engine.chat_images_events`** (migration 0045): the full usage
block, the assembled wire prompt (`composed_prompt` — style preset + persona
appearance + subject, exactly what an image vendor would receive), the
chain-walk facts (`attempts` / `last_failure`), and the five raw inputs the
composer saw. `metadata.image.compose_event_id` points at that row — reverse
lookup runs assistant row → `compose_event_id` → `chat_images_events`, never
the other way. Usage/cost and the composed wire prompt are *not* duplicated
onto `chat_messages.metadata.image` itself; reconcile either against the
audit table (join on `compose_event_id`) or the generation id against your
provider's logs. See [LLM audit → Image-path event
tables](llm-audit.md#image-path-event-tables). Specs:
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-02-image-compose-audit-design.md`
(`metadata.image` keys above) and
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-14-image-audit-events-design.md`
(`chat_images_events`).

### `[tasks.chat_image_edit_compose]` — image-EDIT composer (optional)

Powers `POST
/v2/comp/session/{session_id}/message/{message_id}/image/edit` (see
[api-reference.md](api-reference.md)): the consumer names an existing image
turn and an instruction ("换套衣服"), and this task composes a new image
prompt from that picture's subject plus the instruction. Same shape as
`[tasks.chat_image_prompt_compose]` above (`model`, `fallback`,
`retry_depth`, `temperature`, `max_tokens`, `reasoning`, sampling knobs), and
`filter_prompt` is likewise **optional** and accepts the same three shapes
(plain / array-by-index / table-by-key), selected per request via
`prompt_variant` on the edit body.

**This block is optional even for the endpoint.** With it absent, the
endpoint runs on `[tasks.chat_image_prompt_compose]`'s chain and parameters,
using the engine's built-in edit prompt instead of the chat composer's own
`filter_prompt` (which is written to compose from conversation context, not
to revise a picture) — so configuring image turns is already enough to get
edits, with no further config. With **both** blocks absent, the endpoint
answers 501. Configure this block to give edits their own model or their own
prompt.

Because the fallback path resolves through `[tasks.chat_image_prompt_compose]`
itself (`resolve("chat_image_prompt_compose", None)`), it advances that
task's round-robin `model` cursor exactly like a chat image compose call
does — heavy edit traffic on a deployment with no edit block shifts which
model the *next chat image compose* lands on.

Call site: `crates/eros-engine-server/src/routes/image_edit.rs` via
`resolve_image_edit_compose()` in `model_config.rs`.

### `[tasks.chat_vision]` — image input (vision pre-stage, opt-in)

When a chat turn carries an `image_url`, the engine runs `resolve_vision()` to
obtain a vision-capable model and `filter_prompt`, calls that model to describe
the image into a fixed JSON schema (`description`, `ocr_text`, `people`, `scene`),
and folds the result into the user-facing prompt before the main chat call. The
main `chat_companion` model stays text-only.

The feature is **off by default** and activates only when this task block exists
with a non-blank `filter_prompt`. `retry_depth` defaults to `1` (primary +
first fallback). Pick a vision-capable model; the example uses
`google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite`.

Wire parameters beyond this block's own keys reach the describe call through
`[[providers.<name>.body]]` rules scoped to `tasks = ["chat_vision"]` — the
route for anything the `reasoning` object cannot express, `reasoning_effort`
included. See "`[[providers.<name>.body]]` — custom body parameters" above.

Call site: `crates/eros-engine-server/src/pipeline/stream.rs` via
`resolve_vision()` in `model_config.rs`.

### `[tasks.chat_product_qa]` — out-of-character product answers (opt-in)

Powers the PDE judge's `product_qa` action: when the end user asks about the
downstream product itself ("这个 app 是什么？", "怎么收费？", "会员怎么取消？"),
the judge routes the turn to this task's own model chain instead of
`chat_companion`. `filter_prompt` (the product documentation + answering
rules) becomes the executor's **entire** system prompt — no persona is
folded in, the companion steps fully out of character for the turn.

**Three enablement gates** — all must hold (`resolve_product_qa()` /
`validate_product_qa_prompt()`):

| Gate | State | Behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `[tasks.pde_decision].filter_prompt` set | off | The rule engine never emits `product_qa` — the action is unreachable without the LLM judge. If `[tasks.chat_product_qa]` is configured anyway, boot logs one WARN (`"model_config: [tasks.chat_product_qa] is configured but the LLM PDE ([tasks.pde_decision].filter_prompt) is disabled — product_qa is inert"`) and the block stays inert. |
| `[tasks.chat_product_qa]` block present | absent | Feature off. The judge context carries no product-QA lines; a hallucinated `product_qa` verdict degrades to `reply_text`. |
| `chat_product_qa.filter_prompt` non-blank | blank | **Refuses to boot** — the same required-prompt contract as `insight_extraction` / `memory_extraction`. Set a prompt, or remove the `[tasks.chat_product_qa]` section entirely to disable the feature. |

```toml
[tasks.chat_product_qa]
model        = "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5"
fallback     = ["google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite"]
retry_depth  = 1
temperature  = 0.3
max_tokens   = 800

```

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `model` | `ModelSpec` (string \| array \| table) | — | Primary executor model (same three shapes as `chat_companion.model`). |
| `fallback` | `String` \| `Array<String>` | `[]` | Sequential retry chain (FallbackSpec), truncated to `retry_depth`. |
| `retry_depth` | `u32` | `1` | Primary + this many fallbacks. |
| `temperature` | `f64` | task default | Sampling temperature for the executor call. |
| `max_tokens` | `u32` | task default | Token cap for the executor call. |
| `top_p` | `f32` | absent | Nucleus sampling, `(0.0, 1.0]`. Omitted from the request when unset. |
| `frequency_penalty` | `f32` | absent | OpenAI-style frequency penalty, `[-2.0, 2.0]`. Omitted when unset. |
| `presence_penalty` | `f32` | absent | OpenAI-style presence penalty, `[-2.0, 2.0]`. Omitted when unset. |
| `repetition_penalty` | `f32` | absent | Repetition penalty, `(0.0, 2.0]` (`1.0` = no-op). Omitted when unset. |
| `reasoning` | table | absent | Optional reasoning control forwarded to OpenRouter. |
| `filter_prompt` | `String` | — | **Required.** Product docs + answering rules; blank or absent refuses to boot (see the gates table above). |

**Judge-side context.** Only when all three gates pass, the judge context
(`build_pde_ctx`) gains two lines the prompt can act on:

- `[产品咨询] 本轮可答产品问题=是` — availability line, rendered only when the
  task is enabled (feature-off deployments see zero prompt drift, zero token
  cost).
- `[最近产品咨询]` — the session's most recent **3** product-QA pairs
  (`channel='product_qa'`), so elliptical follow-ups ("那多少钱一个月？")
  still route to `product_qa`. Omitted when there are none. The same 3 pairs
  are reused as the executor's own conversational context — no second store
  fetch.

**Isolation semantics.** The answer persists as a normal assistant row
(`role='assistant'`, `assistant_action_type='reply'`) marked
`channel='product_qa'`. That marker makes the row invisible to the companion
brain: conversation signals
(`compute_signals_for_session`), the judge's own shared companion transcript
(`build_input_filter_transcript`), and the companion's live message window
(`model_facing_history`) all filter `channel IS NOT NULL` rows out. The
dreaming sweeper excludes it too, but not via a blanket non-NULL filter — by
default it also reads `'voice'` rows (see
[memory-layers.md](memory-layers.md#voice-turns)), so only `product_qa`
stays out — while the row stays fully visible on the live SSE stream,
disconnect-replay, and client history (`channel` is exposed on both history
projections). See [architecture.md](architecture.md) for the full
`chat_messages.channel` semantics.

**Failure fallback.** If the executor's whole candidate chain (`model` +
`fallback`) is exhausted without streaming any content, the engine does
**not** fall back to the in-character companion reply — the companion
doesn't know the product facts, and improvising is exactly what this feature
exists to prevent. It instead picks a configured `error_handling` fallback
phrase (the same DB-backed mechanism the rest of the chat stream uses) and
persists it **with the `channel='product_qa'` marker**, so replay and
idempotency still hold; with no fallback phrase configured, the turn ends in
an `Error` frame instead.

Call site: `crates/eros-engine-server/src/pipeline/stream.rs` via
`resolve_product_qa()` in `model_config.rs`.

### `[tasks.embedding]` — active

`VoyageClient` used to hard-code `voyage-3-lite`; `[tasks.embedding]` is now
consumed, and the embedding model, and which backend it routes to, are
config-driven.

```toml
# Single model — read and write use the same backend.
[tasks.embedding]
model = "voyage-4-lite"                       # ≡ "voyage-4-lite@voyage"
# model = "voyage-3-lite"                     # legacy pin (no longer recommended by Voyage)
# model = "openai/text-embedding-3-small@openrouter"
# model = "bge-m3@local"                      # third-party, OpenRouter-compatible wire

# OR: split read/write — voyage-4 series and above ONLY.
#[tasks.embedding]
#model_read  = "voyage-4-lite"   # recall path: embed_query, input_type "query"
#model_write = "voyage-4"        # storage path: embed_document(s), input_type "document"
```

**Dimensions are fixed at 512, with no config knob.** The three pgvector
columns are `VECTOR(512) NOT NULL`, the clients request 512 on the wire, and
every response is length-checked. There used to be a `dimensions` field on
`[tasks.<name>]` — it was never consumed and has been removed; a leftover
`dimensions = 512` line in an existing config is now an inert unknown key
(serde ignores it, exactly like any other stale key).

| field | type | rules |
|---|---|---|
| `model` | single fixed string | bare ⇒ `@voyage`; `@openrouter` / `@<custom>` route to the OpenRouter-compatible wire; mutually exclusive with the pair |
| `model_read` | `Option<String>` | pair-only, voyage-only, N ≥ 4 (see the gate below); serves `embed_query` |
| `model_write` | `Option<String>` | pair-only, voyage-only, N ≥ 4; serves `embed_document` / `embed_documents` |
| `top_p` / `frequency_penalty` / `presence_penalty` / `repetition_penalty` | `f32` | **Refuses to boot.** Embeddings take no chat-shaped sampling parameters, so the key could never do anything — delete it. See issue #246. |

Routing per suffix, resolved by `ModelConfig::resolve_embedding()`:

| bare (no suffix) | `@openrouter` | `@voyage` | `@<custom>` |
|---|---|---|---|
| native Voyage | built-in OpenRouter embeddings endpoint (overridable, see `[providers].openrouter` above) | same as bare | `[providers].<name>.embeddings` (OpenRouter-compatible wire) |

- `model_read` / `model_write` are plain `Option<String>` — array/table
  shapes are type errors at parse time. `model_read = model_write` is legal
  (redundant but harmless — equivalent to `model`). `@openrouter` and
  `@<custom>` refuse to boot on `model_read`/`model_write` (only Voyage
  guarantees a shared vector space across model sizes).
- `[tasks.embedding]` **absent** ⇒ native Voyage with `voyage-4-lite`
  (`output_dimension: 512` on the wire). Voyage no longer recommends
  `voyage-3-lite`; a deployment that still needs it must pin it explicitly.
  Switching models over existing data changes the vector space — old rows
  are not comparable to new queries — so either pin the old model or
  re-embed.
- `model` must be a single fixed string; round-robin, weighted, `fallback`,
  and `tiers` all refuse to boot (mixed/incompatible vector spaces would be
  the result — the `chat_voice` fixed-only precedent).
- The wire has no `input_type`: the query/document optimisation is a
  Voyage-native nuance. Routing embedding off Voyage forfeits it.

**The voyage-4 gate.** Applied to the bare id after stripping an optional
`@voyage` suffix. The id must begin `voyage-` followed by a numeric segment
(ASCII digits and dots only, ending at the next `-` or end of string) that
parses as a finite number ≥ 4:

- ✓ `voyage-4`, `voyage-4-lite`, `voyage-4.5-large`, `voyage-10`
- ✗ `voyage-3.5-lite` (N = 3.5), `voyage-code-3` (no leading numeric segment
  after `voyage-`), `voyage-inf`/`voyage-nan` (non-digit characters, and
  non-finite even if they parsed), `bge-m3@local` (not voyage), any
  `@openrouter` or custom-provider slug

Only the voyage-4 series and above guarantee a shared vector space across
model sizes — mixing a lower or non-numeric model into the pair would
silently write vectors the read model cannot compare, so the gate is a boot
refusal, not a docs footnote.

**`VOYAGE_API_KEY`** is required iff the resolved read or write backend is
Voyage (block absent ⇒ Voyage default ⇒ still required, so existing
deployments see no change). A deployment that routes both read and write
entirely off Voyage no longer needs the var.

Call site: `crates/eros-engine-server/src/main.rs` builds
`eros_engine_llm::embedding::EmbeddingRouter::from_config(&model_config)`
once at boot; `AppState.embed: Arc<EmbeddingRouter>` serves `embed_query` /
`embed_document` / `embed_documents` from `handlers.rs` / `post_process.rs`
/ `dreaming.rs` / `world.rs` / `story.rs`, unchanged call shapes.

### Enabling / disabling extraction

`insight_extraction` (stage 1 of the human chain, per-turn fact mining),
`memory_extraction` (session-end dreaming sweeper), `character_insight_extraction`
(stage 1 of the experimental character chain, §"Task names" above), and
`user_insight_extraction` (stage 1 of the experimental user chain) are
controlled by the **presence of their `[tasks.*_extraction]` section** — this
is `validate_extraction_prompts()`'s gate, and all four names are in it:

- **Section present** → `filter_prompt` is **required**; the server refuses to boot
  if it is blank or absent.
- **Section absent** → that extraction is **off**. The engine boots and runs without
  it (`insight_extraction` is skipped per turn; the dreaming sweeper stays inert;
  the character chain — both stages — never runs; the user chain — both
  stages — never runs).

`insight_structuring`, `character_insight_structuring`, and
`user_insight_structuring` — stage 2 of each of the three chains — are
**deliberately NOT in this gate**, because this gate *requires* a prompt and
no stage-2 block may have one. Each is gated in the opposite direction
instead: its prompt is built in `prompt.rs`, so setting `filter_prompt` on it
refuses to boot (see `affinity_evaluation` above — same dead-config rule).
"Not in this gate" means "gated the other way", not "ungated".

If you copy the shipped example and blank out
`[tasks.character_insight_extraction].filter_prompt` expecting the feature to
just go quiet, it instead refuses to boot — remove the section entirely to
disable the chain.

> **Behavior change (0.6.x):** earlier releases made both sections mandatory (an
> absent section boot-failed). They are now optional-by-omission. The shipped
> `examples/model_config.toml` keeps both sections, so the default — both
> extractions on — is unchanged.

`reasoning` works the same as on every task — omit it to let the model decide,
`reasoning = { enabled = false }` to force reasoning off, `{ enabled = true }` to
force it on.

## Resolution rules

For `model` and `fallback`:

```
matched tier block > task default block > [defaults] > compiled-in fallback
```

For `allow_traits`:

```
matched tier block > task default block
```

For `temperature` and `max_tokens`:

```
task default block > [defaults] > compiled-in fallback
```

For `top_p`, `frequency_penalty`, `presence_penalty`, and `repetition_penalty`:

```
task default block only (absent ⇒ the wire param is omitted)
```

Where each step contributes:

- **Matched tier block** — `[tasks.<name>.tiers.<tier>]`, where `<tier>` comes from the `tier` field of the chat request (regex `^[a-z0-9_]{1,32}$`). If the requested tier is absent or unknown (no matching sub-table), the task default block is used and a `tracing::warn!` is emitted. This step exists for `chat_companion` and `chat_output_filter` only — every other task skips straight to its default block, and carrying a tier block refuses to boot.
- **Task default block** — `[tasks.<name>]`.
- **`[defaults]`** — top-level defaults block.
- **Compiled-in fallback** — `x-ai/grok-4-mini`, temperature `0.5`, max_tokens `200`. Hard-coded in `model_config.rs`.

`temperature`, `max_tokens`, and the four sampling knobs (`top_p`,
`frequency_penalty`, `presence_penalty`, `repetition_penalty`) are task-level
only — per-tier sub-tables do not override them. The four sampling knobs have
no `[defaults]` fallback and no compiled-in default either: unset means the
wire param is omitted entirely, never sent with an engine-chosen value.

If `resolve()` is called with an unknown task name, it falls back through `defaults → compiled-in` and emits a `tracing::warn!` ("model_config: unknown task, using defaults").

## Primary model selection

`model` (task-level and per-tier) accepts three shapes:

```toml
model = "x-ai/grok-4.20"                              # fixed
model = ["x-ai/grok-4.20", "z-ai/glm-4.7-flash"]     # round-robin (deterministic)
model = { "x-ai/grok-4.20" = 0.8, "z-ai/glm-4.7-flash" = 0.2 }  # weighted random
```

- **Round-robin** alternates deterministically across calls (per-process counter; resets on restart; each replica counts independently).
- **Weighted** draws randomly; weights are any positive numbers, normalized by their sum (`{a = 8, b = 2}` == `{a = 0.8, b = 0.2}`). Non-positive weights are dropped.
- `["a","b"]` and `{a = 1, b = 1}` produce the same long-run distribution but differ in mechanism (deterministic vs. random).
- A single-entry array/table behaves like a fixed string. An empty array/table falls through to the next precedence level.

**TOML gotcha:** inline-table keys allow only `A-Za-z0-9_-`, but model ids contain `/` and `.`, so weighted keys **must be quoted**: `{ "x-ai/grok-4.20" = 0.8 }`. The array form needs no quoting.

### Fallback dedup

After the primary is selected, any occurrence of that exact id is removed from the resolved `fallback` chain — retrying a model that just failed is wasted. With round-robin/weighted primaries this is dynamic: only the id chosen for that call is dropped.

### Fallback truncation (`retry_depth`)

After deduplication the chain is truncated to `retry_depth` entries — a call tries the primary, then at most `retry_depth` fallbacks; anything past the truncation point is never tried. `retry_depth` is settable task-level, and per tier on the two tier-aware tasks (tier > task default).

The default differs by task. The generic `resolve()` uses `2` (primary + 2 fallbacks — so `chat_companion` tries at most 3 models per streaming chat burst); the single-purpose tasks (`chat_output_filter`, `chat_input_filter`, `chat_vision`, `pde_decision`, `chat_product_qa`, `chat_image_prompt_compose`, `chat_image_edit_compose`) use `1` (primary + first fallback).

## Stability commitments

These commitments were made during `0.x` and **carry forward unchanged into
`1.x`**. For the duration of `1.x`, the OSS engine commits to:

1. **No removed fields.** Existing field names in `[defaults]` and `[tasks.<name>]` will not disappear.
   (Exceptions to date, both documented above: `[tasks.embedding].dimensions`
   — removed, now a silently-ignored inert unknown key; `[defaults].ignore_providers`
   / `.provider_sort` — removed, a leftover key refuses to boot with a
   migration message.)
2. **No renamed fields.** `fallback` will not become `fallback_model`. `model` will not become `primary_model`. Etc.
3. **No newly required fields.** Anything added is optional with a sensible default.
4. **No removed task names from this list:** `chat_companion`, `insight_extraction`, `pde_decision`, `embedding`.
5. **Resolution precedence is fixed.** `matched tier > task default block > [defaults] > compiled-in fallback` for `model`/`fallback`/`allow_traits`. `temperature`/`max_tokens` are task-level only, as are `top_p`/`frequency_penalty`/`presence_penalty`/`repetition_penalty` (which additionally have no `[defaults]` and no compiled-in fallback).
6. **`model` accepts a string, array (round-robin), or table (weighted).** A plain string remains valid forever; the array/table forms are an additive widening.

What may still change without notice:

- Compiled-in fallback values (currently `x-ai/grok-4-mini` / `0.5` / `200`). These are fail-safes, not contract.
- Internal struct shapes inside `eros-engine-llm` if `#[non_exhaustive]` is added.
- The `description` field's handling — it's documentation today, may become structured metadata later.
- *Future* new optional fields and new task names beyond those documented here. (The fields documented above — including `allow_traits` and `tiers` — are covered by commitments 1–3.)

### Changelog note

- **`persona_override` (`art_metadata.model`) is no longer read by the engine as of this version.** Use `[tasks.<name>.tiers.<tier>]` for per-tier model selection instead. The `model` field may still exist in a persona's JSONB `art_metadata` but is silently ignored.
- `model_name_display_override` (optional, `[tasks.chat_companion]`): added in
  0.x. When unset the chat `meta.model` field is **omitted** — a change from the
  earlier "always present" behavior. The shipped example sets `= true` to keep
  showing the real id.
- `output_filter` (optional bool, `[tasks.chat_companion]` and per-tier): added in
  0.x. Default `false`. Enables the second-pass reply rewrite via `[tasks.chat_output_filter]`.
- `[tasks.chat_output_filter]` (new task): added in 0.x. Absent by default (filter
  is inert). See "output_filter — second-pass reply rewrite" above.
- SSE `final`-frame fields `filtered`, `retries_chat`, `retries_filter`,
  `prompt_injected`, `tier`: added in 0.x.
- `output_regex` (optional array, `[tasks.chat_companion]`): added in 0.x.
  Task-level only (no per-tier override). Deterministic regex strips applied
  before the client sees the reply, before the LLM `output_filter`, and before
  extract. The `filtered` flag is `true` when either the regex strip or the LLM
  filter (or both) produced non-raw output. See "`output_regex` — deterministic
  per-model regex strip" above.
- **`[tasks.embedding]` is now active** (previously reserved and unconsumed).
  Breaking changes bundled with the activation: `[providers]` values are now
  tables, not plain strings (the string shape is rejected with no compat
  layer); `[defaults].ignore_providers` entries now require the
  `@openrouter` suffix; the `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` env var is gone (use
  `[providers].openrouter.chat`/`.embeddings`); the `OPENROUTER_APP_*` env
  vars are soft-deprecated (silently ignored, use
  `[providers].openrouter.headers`); the `dimensions` field on
  `[tasks.<name>]` was removed (dims are hard-coded 512; a leftover
  `dimensions = 512` line is now an inert unknown key). See "`[providers]`"
  and "`[tasks.embedding]` — active" above.
- **`[defaults].ignore_providers` and `[defaults].provider_sort` are
  removed** (the entry above described their earlier mandatory
  `@openrouter`-suffix form). OpenRouter routing prefs are now
  `[[providers.<name>.body]]` rules on the `openrouter` entry — see
  "`[[providers.<name>.body]]` — custom body parameters" above. A leftover
  key refuses to boot with a migration message. The removed keys also fed
  the `chat_vision` request body; body rules reach vision as well, so an
  untargeted rule restores `provider` prefs on the vision call.
- **`top_p` / `frequency_penalty` / `presence_penalty` now apply to every task
  except `embedding`**, and **`repetition_penalty` is new** with the same
  scoping. Previously the three were resolved but carried only by
  `chat_companion`: setting them on any other task parsed, booted, and
  silently did nothing (issue #246). Two boot gates ship with this, and both
  are **behavior changes** for a config that already carries such a value:
  out-of-range or non-finite values now refuse to boot (`top_p` `(0.0, 1.0]`,
  the two OpenAI penalties `[-2.0, 2.0]`, `repetition_penalty` `(0.0, 2.0]`),
  and any of the four on `[tasks.embedding]` refuses to boot. A config that
  sets none of the four produces byte-identical request bodies.

## What this config does NOT control

- **Voyage's own base URL** — the native Voyage wire always posts to Voyage's canonical endpoint; only the model id is configurable, via `[tasks.embedding]`. Route around Voyage entirely with an `@openrouter` or custom `[providers]` suffix instead.
- **PDE decisions (default path)** — the rule engine in `eros-engine-core/src/pde.rs` runs unconditionally when no `filter_prompt` is set. Set `[tasks.pde_decision].filter_prompt` to activate the opt-in LLM judge; the rule engine then serves as fallback + hard-safety guardrails.
- **OpenRouter API key** — read directly from `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, not the config file.
- **Per-call streaming / response format flags** — fixed in `OpenRouterClient`.

## Worked example: tier-based resolution

```toml
[tasks.chat_companion]
model        = "x-ai/grok-4.20"
fallback     = ["thedrummer/cydonia-24b-v4.1", "x-ai/grok-4.3", "qwen/qwen3.6-flash"]
temperature  = 0.8
max_tokens   = 1200
allow_traits = ["allow_politics"]

[tasks.chat_companion.tiers.free]
model        = "qwen/qwen3.6-flash"
fallback     = ["deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash"]
allow_traits = ["allow_politics"]

[tasks.chat_companion.tiers.gold]
model        = "x-ai/grok-4.20"
fallback     = ["thedrummer/cydonia-24b-v4.1", "x-ai/grok-4.3"]
allow_traits = ["allow_nsfw", "allow_politics"]
```

When a request arrives with `"tier": "gold"`, `resolve("chat_companion", "gold")` returns:

| Field | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `model` | `x-ai/grok-4.20` | `tiers.gold` |
| `fallback` | `["thedrummer/cydonia-24b-v4.1", "x-ai/grok-4.3"]` | `tiers.gold` |
| `allow_traits` | `["allow_nsfw", "allow_politics"]` | `tiers.gold` |
| `temperature` | `0.8` | task default block (no tier override) |
| `max_tokens` | `1200` | task default block (no tier override) |

When a request arrives with `"tier": "free"`:

| Field | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `model` | `qwen/qwen3.6-flash` | `tiers.free` |
| `fallback` | `["deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash"]` | `tiers.free` |
| `allow_traits` | `["allow_politics"]` | `tiers.free` |
| `temperature` | `0.8` | task default block |
| `max_tokens` | `1200` | task default block |

When no `tier` is sent (or an unknown tier is sent), all fields resolve from the task default block.

## Compatibility test fixture

`model_config.rs` includes a fixture that asserts every field of a representative TOML round-trips correctly. Any breaking schema change will fail CI before it ships. See `compat_fixture_locks_full_schema` in `crates/eros-engine-llm/src/model_config.rs`.
