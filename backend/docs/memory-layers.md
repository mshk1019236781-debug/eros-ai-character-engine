# Memory layers

[English](memory-layers.md) · [中文](memory-layers.zh.md)

Two pgvector tables hold what the persona remembers about you. They serve different recall needs and are queried separately.

## Profile vs Relationship

| Layer | `instance_id` | What it holds | Lifetime |
|-------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| **Profile** | `NULL` | Cross-session facts about the user — things any persona could know. | Permanent |
| **Relationship** | `<uuid>` | Per-session callbacks — the small things this specific persona shared with this user. | Per session |

The distinction matters because **persona stability across personas** is different from **intimacy within a relationship**. If you tell Aria you're allergic to peanuts, that's a profile fact — Kenji should know it too. If Aria mentioned she's reading Bishop tonight, that's a relationship memory — Kenji shouldn't pretend to know.

## Storage

Single table, two layers distinguished by `instance_id`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE engine.companion_memories (
    id           UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    session_id   UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES engine.chat_sessions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_id      UUID NOT NULL,
    instance_id  UUID,                         -- NULL = profile layer
    content      TEXT NOT NULL,
    embedding    VECTOR(512) NOT NULL,
    category     TEXT,                         -- fact|preference|event|emotion|relation; NULL on raw-turn rows
    metadata     JSONB,                        -- opaque per-memory extraction payload; NULL on raw-turn rows
    created_at   TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

Two filtered indexes — one per layer — keep retrieval cheap on the hot path:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_memories_user_profile
  ON engine.companion_memories(user_id)
  WHERE instance_id IS NULL;

CREATE INDEX idx_memories_session
  ON engine.companion_memories(session_id)
  WHERE instance_id IS NOT NULL;
```

## Embedding

`voyage-4-lite` via Voyage's native API by default. 512 dimensions, multilingual — the schema is `VECTOR(512)`, and non-Voyage routes have `dimensions: 512` forced on the wire.

`[tasks.embedding]` picks the route. A `@provider` suffix on `model` sends the calls elsewhere: `@openrouter` uses the built-in OpenRouter embeddings endpoint (URL overridable via `[providers].openrouter.embeddings`), and `@<name>` uses any `[providers]` entry that declares an `embeddings` URL (key read from `<NAME>_API_KEY`). Alternatively a `model_read`/`model_write` pair splits the recall and storage models independently — the pair must appear together, is mutually exclusive with `model`, and is restricted to Voyage models of the voyage-4 series and above, the only lineup guaranteeing one shared vector space across model sizes.

```rust
// crates/eros-engine-llm/src/embedding.rs — EmbeddingRouter
pub async fn embed_query(&self, text: &str) -> Result<Vec<f32>, LlmError>;    // read backend
pub async fn embed_document(&self, text: &str) -> Result<Vec<f32>, LlmError>; // write backend
```

`embed_query` serves the per-turn recall path, `embed_document` the storage paths. On the Voyage backend the two become different `input_type` hints (`query` vs `document`); the OpenRouter-compatible wire has no such hint, so there the split only matters when `model_read`/`model_write` actually differ.

The engine still **fails loud** on missing secrets — but the `VOYAGE_API_KEY` boot gate fires only when the resolved route includes a Voyage backend; OpenRouter and custom routes are gated on their own keys (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` / `<NAME>_API_KEY`) instead. The closed-source eros-gateway has a known regression where an empty key silently disables embeddings; eros-engine declined to inherit that.

## Retrieval

Cosine similarity via pgvector's `<=>` operator with an IVFFlat index:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_memories_embedding
  ON engine.companion_memories
  USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
  WITH (lists = 100);
```

Profile-layer search:

```sql
SELECT id, session_id, user_id, instance_id, content, category, metadata, created_at
FROM engine.companion_memories
WHERE user_id = $1 AND instance_id IS NULL
ORDER BY embedding <=> $2::vector
LIMIT $3;
```

Relationship-layer search filters on `instance_id = $2` instead and adds `content NOT LIKE '%\nAI：%'` (`$3`) to exclude legacy verbatim-transcript rows (issue #113), shifting the embedding to `$4` and the limit to `$5`. No similarity score is computed anywhere — results are ordered by the raw `<=>` cosine distance and retrieval is pure top-K via `LIMIT`; there is no similarity threshold, so the K nearest rows come back regardless of absolute distance.

`lists = 100` is a balanced default for small-to-medium tables (≲ 1M rows). Tune up for larger corpora (rule of thumb: `lists ≈ √rows`).

## What gets embedded

Two independent writers, on different schedules:

1. **Raw-turn writer** (`write_turn`, post-process) — runs on **every** substantive turn (non-empty user utterance and at least one non-empty assistant message). It embeds **the user's utterance only** into *both* layers — never the assistant's prose, which fed back into the model's own prompt via recall and collapsed replies to a repeated line (issue #113). The relationship-layer copy is prefixed `用户：` so a recalled line stays readable as "what the user said." These rows carry `category = NULL` and `metadata = NULL`.
2. **Dreaming-lite sweeper** (`[tasks.memory_extraction]`, `pipeline::dreaming`) — a background, idle-session-triggered pass that asks an LLM for durable memory candidates. It writes **profile-layer rows only**, tagged `category ∈ {fact, preference, event, emotion, relation}` (anything else the model invents collapses to `fact`) plus an opaque `metadata` payload.

`insight_extraction` is a **separate** pipeline and writes nothing to this table — its structured output is UPSERTed directly into the flat `human_insights` table (per-column incremental merge; see [api-reference.md](api-reference.md#get-compuseruser_idprofile)), not embedded here. Two further experimental, per-relationship chains (`character_insight_*`, `user_insight_*`) work the same way, UPSERTing into their own flat tables — `character_insights` (see [api-reference.md](api-reference.md#get-v2compinstanceinstance_idinsightcharacter)) and `user_insights` (see [api-reference.md](api-reference.md#get-v2compinstanceinstance_idinsightuser)); like `human_insights`, neither table is embedded into this one. `user_insights` is not injected into any chat, voice, or PDE prompt; `character_insights` is — four of its fields render the chat prompt's `[character_state]` block, and how completely the row is filled sizes the injected history window (see [deploying.md](deploying.md#operational-notes)).

So embeddings *are* generated once per substantive turn, not only for LLM-surfaced highlights.

## What doesn't get stored

Raw chat messages live in `engine.chat_messages` (full transcript, plain text). They are **not** embedded. The memory tables hold *summaries* and *facts*, not the full message log. If you want to retrieve the actual transcript, query `chat_messages` directly — that's the source of truth for what was said.

## Retrieval and injection

Memory is read back into the prompt on each chat turn, gated by the per-request
`memory_scope` (values and default in [api-reference.md](api-reference.md);
default `neutral_and_relationship`). The reply handler (`pipeline::handlers`)
builds a profile/relationship context block from two sources:

- **Profile layer** — two merged sources. The 基础画像 bullets come directly
  from the flat **`human_insights`** table — the insight extractor's only
  write target since the companion_insights teardown (spec 2026-08-11); there
  is no JSONB blob or mirror step anymore. `memory_scope` decides
  whether intimate fields are included (`full` / `insights_only`) or only the
  neutral subset (`neutral_*`). Alongside them, profile-layer
  `companion_memories` rows are pulled by similarity search and grouped by
  `category`, but only when the scope keeps profile memory (`full` /
  `neutral_and_relationship`) — `relationship_only`, `neutral_only`,
  `insights_only`, and `none` skip this half entirely, leaving only the
  `human_insights` bullets (where the scope still produces any).
- **Relationship layer** — `companion_memories` rows pulled by semantic
  (embedding) similarity search against the current turn, included when the
  scope keeps relationship memory (`full` / `neutral_and_relationship` /
  `relationship_only`).

`memory_scope = none` skips memory injection entirely. **`memory_scope` gates
prompt injection only — never writes.** Even under `none`, the raw-turn writer
still embeds and stores this turn, and insight extraction and the affinity
evaluation still run; there is currently no scope value that suppresses
writing. The frontend's `/comp/user/{user_id}/profile` endpoint returns the
typed `human_insights` row as a human-readable view of what's been collected.

### Voice turns

The voice endpoint (`POST /comp/voice/{session_id}/turn/stream`) reads from
the same two layers through a leaner, voice-specific path — see
[api-reference.md](api-reference.md#post-compvoicesession_idturnstream) for
the request shape and [model-config.md](model-config.md) for the
`[tasks.chat_voice]` block.

- **Bootstrap snapshot** — assembled once, on a session's first turn, and
  frozen into `chat_sessions.metadata.voice_bootstrap`; re-injected verbatim
  on every later turn (OpenRouter is stateless, so there is no "inject once"
  on the wire — later turns cannot change it). Two parts: `human_insights`
  bullets at Neutral tier by default (tunable via that first turn's
  `memory_scope`), and the previous voice call's last 8 messages rendered as
  a plain transcript. Each part degrades independently; a failed assembly
  leaves the marker unwritten so the next turn retries.
- **Per-turn recall** — the same `companion_memories` search as the chat
  path (`memory_scope`-gated, cross-layer dedup via `memory_hygiene`) but at
  a much smaller K: grouped profile 1/category + raw fallback 2 +
  relationship 2 (chat's tier is 2/4/3), wrapped in a 300 ms budget — a
  timeout or search error just drops that turn's recall block, with a warn
  log, never an error frame. An utterance under 4 alphanumeric characters
  after stripping whitespace/punctuation (嗯 / 好啊 / 哈哈-style
  backchannels) skips recall entirely, with no embedding call. Deployment
  kill-switch: `[tasks.chat_voice] recall = false` (default `true`) always
  wins over the request's `memory_scope`.
- **Post-call writes only** — a live voice turn never writes: no raw-turn
  embed, no insight extraction, no affinity eval. What a call *does* leave
  behind is written after it ends: once the session has been idle for
  `DREAMING_IDLE_SECS`, the dreaming-lite sweeper reads its transcript and
  distills categorized profile-layer `companion_memories` rows, exactly as it
  does for text sessions. Those rows are ordinary memories — later calls and
  text chats both recall them. Inline TTS audio tags (`[laughs]`, `[sighs]`,
  when `tts_audio_tags` is on) are stripped from voice assistant rows first,
  so stage directions never become memory text. Operators can turn the whole
  behavior off with `DREAMING_VOICE_DISABLED=1`, which restores the earlier
  text-only sweeper filter; note that a call swept while the flag was on is
  never re-swept after turning it off (`classified_at` is stamped once).
  Relationship-layer rows are still never written from voice.
- **What a barge-in leaves behind** — an interrupted turn contributes the text
  the client reported as actually spoken, not the full generation, so the
  sweeper distills what the user *heard*. A turn cut off before the first
  audible word contributes only the user's line, because no assistant row is
  written at all. Either way the transcript matches the call, which is the
  whole point of recording the interrupt.
