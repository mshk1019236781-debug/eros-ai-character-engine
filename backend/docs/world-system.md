# World system

[English](world-system.md) · [中文](world-system.zh.md)

An experimental, fully opt-in subsystem that gives each user a simulated
"world": the roster of personas they own, whose relationships and daily life
evolve off-screen and feed back into chat. It has two layers, shipped as two
stacked features:

- **World Memories** — a scheduled "world director" LLM evolves a persistent
  relationship graph and writes daily script fragments per persona; chat
  injects each persona's world digest plus recalled fragments, so personas
  share one consistent, evolving off-screen life.
- **World Town** — a Weibo/Moments-style feed on top: personas post at
  script-determined times, comment on each other's posts, and the post's
  author replies when the user comments.
- **World Stories** (v2, optional third layer) — each persona gets a private,
  continuously evolving life (work / romance including the user / daily
  living), simulated per `persona_instance` every 8 hours behind an activity
  gate. Stories feed the World Memories director (scripts stay consistent
  with each persona's life) and are injected into chat prompts by default.

Everything is **off by default** and layered behind independent switches — an
unconfigured deployment pays zero cost, runs zero queries, and spawns zero
sweepers.

## The core rule

The user is off-stage. Scripts describe persona↔persona life; personas may
naturally reference the user (via the extracted profile memories fed back to
the director — never raw chat), but the director must never invent user
actions or words. This rule ships as a fixed, non-configurable part of the
director payload.

With World Stories enabled the rule splits by layer: at the **stories** layer
the user is on-stage — romance progression includes the user — but the
director may only *read* user actions out of chat records, never invent them,
and relationship qualification is judged from chat evidence (affinity numbers
are advisory only). The World Memories layer keeps the original rule; user
facts flow in indirectly through story events.

## Enabling it

World Memories turns on only when **all three** hold:

1. `[tasks.world_director]` exists in model config with a non-blank
   `filter_prompt` (the director's system instruction). Missing section ⇒
   completely inert: no sweeper, no per-turn DB queries.
2. The owner has a row in `engine.world_enrollments`. This table is
   **downstream-managed**: your product inserts/deletes rows over a
   `service_role` connection; the engine only reads it. Row present = enabled.
3. `WORLD_DISABLED` is not set.

World Town additionally needs **all** of:

4. `town_enabled = true` on the owner's enrollment row (also
   downstream-written).
5. `[tasks.world_comment]` / `[tasks.world_reply]` sections (each path is
   individually optional — a missing section disables just that path).
6. `WORLD_TOWN_DISABLED` is not set.

## Worldview

Every world runs inside a per-owner **worldview** — a free-text setting
document (sci-fi, modern, ancient, …) stored in `engine.world_worldviews`
(`owner_uid` PK, `content` 1..=10000 chars, `updated_at`). Like
`world_enrollments`, the table is **downstream-managed**: the engine only
ever SELECTs it; downstream INSERTs/UPDATEs/DELETEs rows over the
service_role/owner connection. **The engine ships no default worldview** —
providing one (a deployment default, or forcing the user to write their own)
is entirely the downstream's job.

Semantics:

- **Missing/blank worldview = no World System LLM activity.** An enrolled
  owner without a usable worldview is excluded from WM director rounds,
  story rounds, and town comment/reply scans; the world sweeper logs one
  aggregate warn per tick while any such owner exists. Backfilling the
  table self-heals on the next tick.
- **Change = reset.** The engine stores the SHA-256 of the content each
  round (`world_states.worldview_hash`). A changed worldview makes the
  owner due within one tick and turns the next round into an init-style
  reset: fresh seed, purged script fragments, purged story data
  (insights/events/memories), purged *unpublished* posts. Published posts
  and their comments are kept as read-only feed history, but AI activity
  (comment rounds, replies) only ever targets posts published after the
  current era start (`world_states.worldview_set_at`).
- **Payloads.** The WM director, stories director, and town comment/reply
  payloads all carry the worldview verbatim plus a fixed rule binding all
  settings (era, technology, places, occupations, events) to it. The chat
  prompt is unchanged — chat inherits the worldview through script
  fragments only.

## World Memories

### The director round

Per enrolled owner, every `interval_hours` (default 24), the world sweeper
(tick = `WORLD_TICK_SECS`, default 300s) claims the owner — `FOR UPDATE SKIP
LOCKED` plus a 30-minute stale reclaim, guarded by a claim-ownership token so
a stalled worker can never clobber a newer claim — and makes **one**
structured LLM call:

| Input | Source |
|-------|--------|
| Previous world seed | `world_states.seed` (opaque JSONB; the engine never interprets it) |
| Active roster (cap 8) | `persona_instances` with `status = 'active'`, earliest-created first |
| Memory feedback (K=15) | Most recent **extracted** profile-layer `companion_memories` (dreaming-lite output — never raw chat) |

| Output | Where it goes |
|--------|---------------|
| New seed (relationship graph + arc notes) | `world_states.seed`, versioned |
| Per-persona digest (1-2 sentences) | `world_states.digests`, resident injection |
| Per-persona script fragments | `engine.world_memories`, embedded via one batched Voyage call (512-dim) |

Persistence is a single transaction; any failure (LLM, parse, embed, DB)
rolls back completely and the claim is released — the owner simply retries at
the next due scan. Fragments older than `retention_days` (default 30) are
pruned in the same transaction.

### Chat-time injection

At reply time the persona's prompt gains a `[world_memories]` block: the
resident digest plus top-k script fragments recalled by cosine similarity —
**reusing the query embedding the turn already computed**, so recall adds no
extra Voyage call. The enrollment check rides the same query, and injection
can never block or fail a reply.

`WORLD_PROMPT_DISABLED=true` is the isolation valve: simulation keeps running
and accumulating data, but chat prompts stay untouched. Typical rollout: let
worlds accumulate a few days, inspect the scripts, then open the tap.

## World Town

### Posts

For town-enabled owners the **same director call** also emits scheduled
posts (`instance_id`, `content`, `publish_at`) — no extra round trip. The
engine validates each entry against the active roster, clamps `publish_at`
into the coming interval, and inserts them **unpublished** in the same
transaction. Publishing is a pure-SQL status flip when the time arrives —
zero LLM cost, zero latency at publish time.

`WORLD_TOWN_DISABLED` stops post *generation* too, not just the sweeper — so
flipping town back on never floods feeds with a stale backlog.

### The town sweeper

A separate 30-second-tick sweeper runs three independently-degrading paths:

| Path | Cadence | LLM cost |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Publish** | every tick | none — pure SQL flip of due posts |
| **Comment round** | per owner, every `round_secs` (default 3600) | one batched `[tasks.world_comment]` call — only for owners with *new activity* (posts published or user comments since the previous round). Quiet world ⇒ no call. |
| **Reply responder** | every tick, one candidate per owner | one `[tasks.world_reply]` call per answered thread |

Comment-round authors are validated in the insert itself: must be an active
instance of the same world, and the post's author never comments on their own
post through this path.

When the user comments on a post, the post's author replies — gated in
order:

1. **Activity window** (`reply_window_secs`, default 604800 / 7d): the post's
   *latest* user comment must be within this window. A fresh user comment
   re-stamps the post (`world_posts.last_user_comment_at`), so a months-old
   post re-enters the scan the moment someone comments; a thread that stays
   quiet longer simply drops out of it. This bounds the scan cost to recently
   active threads — an index-driven bound, not a behavior change.
2. **Debounce** (`debounce_secs`, default 90): the *latest* user comment must
   have settled; consecutive user comments collapse into one response that
   sees the whole thread.
3. **Daily cap** (`daily_cap`, default 20 per owner per UTC day) — checked
   before the cooldown so a capped owner never burns a cooldown stamp. At
   cap: silent skip; nothing surfaces on the feed.
4. **Per-post cooldown** (`thread_cooldown_secs`, default 600) — a CAS on the
   post row that doubles as the multi-instance claim.

### Feed API

Two authed endpoints (same JWT contract as `/comp/*`: path `user_id` must
equal the JWT `sub`):

- `GET /world/town/{user_id}/feed?limit=&cursor=` — published posts newest
  first, keyset cursor, each post embedding its full comment thread.
  Unenrolled or town-disabled users get an **empty feed, not an error**.
- `POST /world/town/{user_id}/posts/{post_id}/comments` — adds a user
  comment (1000-char cap); 404 if the post isn't visible to that user.

Schemas live in the OpenAPI spec (`/docs` Scalar UI). Rendering is entirely
downstream's job — the engine only moves data.

## World Stories

Stories turn on only when **all** hold — and it rides the World Memories
base by construction:

1. World Memories itself is enabled (`[tasks.world_director]` configured) —
   the story scan runs as a second phase of the same world sweeper tick,
   right after the WM director scan; if `world_director` is unconfigured the
   sweeper never starts and stories never run.
2. `[tasks.world_stories_director]` exists in model config with a non-blank
   `filter_prompt`.
3. `stories_enabled = true` on the owner's `world_enrollments` row
   (downstream-written, same roster mechanism as `town_enabled`).
4. `WORLD_STORIES_DISABLED` is not set.

### The story round

Per `persona_instance`, every `interval_hours` (default 8), behind an
**activity gate**: only instances chatted with inside `active_window_hours`
(default 72) get a round. A quiet instance's life simply pauses and resumes
the moment chat activity resumes — no catch-up rounds.

| Input | Source |
|-------|--------|
| Current UTC datetime | engine — anchors the relative-time convention |
| Persona | `persona_genomes` via instance: name, personality, backstory (canon) |
| Current insight + digest | `persona_story_insights` row (`last_run_at IS NULL` ⇒ first-round init) |
| Recent events (12) | `persona_story_events`, chronological — continuity + repetition guard |
| Affinity snapshot | latest session's six axes + bond + chemistry + both tier labels — advisory only |
| Chat evidence | messages of this (owner, instance), last `context_days` (default 7), capped by turn count |

| Output | Where it goes |
|--------|---------------|
| Full-replacement insight (fixed flat schema) | `persona_story_insights` profile columns, `insight_version` bumped |
| Digest (1-2 sentences) | `persona_story_insights.digest`, resident injection |
| Events (category + content, capped 6/round) | `persona_story_events`, and embedded verbatim into `persona_story_memories` (1:1, same round/transaction) |

The insight field list is a **fixed flat superset of `human_insights`' typed
columns** (the `human_insights` lesson applied in advance — flat typed columns
from day one, no opaque-JSONB stage; the companion side caught up to this
shape with the companion_insights teardown, spec 2026-08-11): every existing
companion field, reworded to describe the persona, plus four story-exclusive
columns — `work_history`
(工作经历), `romance_history` (感情史), `family_of_origin` (与原生家庭的关系),
`user_relationship` (与用户的关系状态). The list ships as an engine constant;
the operator `filter_prompt` controls each field's *richness*, never the
field list itself.

Persistence mirrors World Memories: single transaction, both
`persona_story_events` and `persona_story_memories` pruned by
`retention_days` (default 30), any failure (LLM, parse, embed, DB) releases
the claim for retry at the next due scan.

### Chat-time injection

A `[world_stories]` block is injected right after `[world_memories]`: the
resident digest plus up to 3 recalled episodes, recalled by cosine
similarity **reusing the turn's already-computed query embedding** — no
extra Voyage call. Injection is **ON by default** once the layer is enabled;
`WORLD_STORIES_PROMPT_DISABLED=true` is the isolation valve (same pattern as
`WORLD_PROMPT_DISABLED`): keep simulating lives, stop injecting them.

### Feeding World Memories

When an owner is stories-active, the WM director's per-persona payload
additionally carries `recent_life` — that instance's story events since the
WM director's last run — plus a fixed rule that WM scripts must stay
consistent with it. Owners without stories see byte-identical WM behavior.
Data flow stays strictly one-way:

```
World Stories (per-instance life)  →  World Memories (persona↔persona graph)  →  World Town (stage)
```

A story round never reads the WM seed or `world_memories` back.

### Relative-time convention

Experience-type insight fields (`work_history`, `romance_history`,
`family_of_origin`) record time as **relative expressions** (n年前/n个月前/
n天前) and life stages (x岁时/上大学时), never absolute dates. The engine
passes the current UTC datetime in every round's payload so the director
refreshes these expressions on each full rewrite — worth keeping in mind
when hand-editing prompts or reading stored rows directly.

## Configuration

Environment (all optional; annotated in [`.env.example`](../.env.example)):

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `WORLD_DISABLED` | off | Master switch: no sweepers, no injection, no per-turn queries |
| `WORLD_PROMPT_DISABLED` | off | Keep simulating, stop injecting (isolation valve) |
| `WORLD_TICK_SECS` | 300 | Director sweeper tick; `0` disables the world sweepers |
| `WORLD_TOWN_DISABLED` | off | Town only: no post generation, no town sweeper; memories keep running |
| `WORLD_STORIES_DISABLED` | off | Stories only: no story rounds, no `[world_stories]` injection; memories keep running |
| `WORLD_STORIES_PROMPT_DISABLED` | off | Keep simulating lives, stop injecting them (isolation valve) |

Model config (full schema in [Model config](model-config.md), working
example in [`examples/model_config.toml`](../examples/model_config.toml)):

```toml
[tasks.world_director]
model = "..."
filter_prompt = "..."   # director system instruction — REQUIRED
interval_hours = 24     # per-owner round cadence
retention_days = 30     # world_memories fragment retention

[tasks.world_comment]
model = "..."
filter_prompt = "..."   # comment-round system instruction — REQUIRED
round_secs = 3600

[tasks.world_reply]
model = "..."
filter_prompt = "..."   # reply-responder system instruction — REQUIRED
debounce_secs = 90
thread_cooldown_secs = 600
daily_cap = 20
reply_window_secs = 604800    # reply-eligibility window after a user comment (7d)

[tasks.world_stories_director]
model = "..."
filter_prompt = "..."       # director system instruction — REQUIRED
interval_hours = 8          # per-instance round cadence
retention_days = 30         # events + memories retention
active_window_hours = 72    # activity gate: chat within this window ⇒ life advances
context_days = 7            # chat/affinity evidence window per round
# NOTE: experience-type insight fields use relative time (n年前/上大学时) —
# see docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-23-world-stories-design.md
```

Boot behavior: a section that is **present but has a blank `filter_prompt`**
refuses to boot (fail loudly over silent misconfig). `WORLD_DISABLED` skips
that validation for all four sections; `WORLD_TOWN_DISABLED` skips it for the
two town sections and `WORLD_STORIES_DISABLED` skips it for
`world_stories_director` — a staged or broken config can never block boot
while its feature is switched off.

## Data model

| Table | Written by | Holds |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| `engine.world_enrollments` | downstream | opt-in rows + `town_enabled` + `stories_enabled` flags |
| `engine.world_worldviews` | downstream | per-owner worldview text (`owner_uid` PK, `content` 1..=10000 chars, `updated_at`) |
| `engine.world_states` | engine | seed, digests, director + comment-round scheduling state, `worldview_hash` (SHA-256 of the content used last round) + `worldview_set_at` (current era start, gates Town AI activity) |
| `engine.world_memories` | engine | script fragments + `VECTOR(512)`, date-keyed retention |
| `engine.world_posts` | engine | scheduled/published posts, reply-cooldown + last-user-comment stamps |
| `engine.world_post_comments` | engine + user route | threads; `author_instance_id IS NULL` = the user |
| `engine.persona_story_insights` | engine | resident flat life profile (fixed schema) + digest + story-round scheduling state, one row per story-eligible instance |
| `engine.persona_story_events` | engine | append-only life-progression log, director-vocabulary `category` + `content`, date-keyed retention |
| `engine.persona_story_memories` | engine | 1:1 embedded mirror of events (`event_id` FK) + `VECTOR(512)`, date-keyed retention |

`stories_enabled` (migration 0038) is downstream-written on the same
`world_enrollments` row as `town_enabled` — identical opt-in contract. All
nine tables get the 0013 lockdown treatment (REVOKE from Supabase browser
roles + policy-less RLS). Unenrolling (or flipping a flag off) stops
simulation and injection immediately but keeps accumulated data —
re-enrolling resumes the same world/life.

## Audit & cost

The three World Memories / Town tasks tag every call with the shared world
sentinel user `11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111112`; `world_stories_director`
tags its own calls with sentinel `11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111113`
(dreaming = `…111`, world = `…112`, stories = `…113` — per-subsystem spend
attribution). Since migration `0059`, all four also write one row per call to
`engine.llm_generations` (`task = world_director` / `world_stories_director` /
`world_comment` / `world_reply`), in addition to the `openrouter: call
completed` tracing line — previously they left no database trace at all. See
[LLM / OpenRouter audit → LLM generations
ledger](llm-audit.md#llm-generations-ledger). Steady-state cost per enrolled owner
**with a worldview** per day is bounded by: 1 director call + at most
`24h/round_secs` comment rounds (only those with activity) + at most
`daily_cap` replies + up to `24h/interval_hours` story calls per
**actively-chatted** instance — and a world nobody touches still costs
exactly one director call. An enrolled owner **without** a usable worldview
costs zero LLM calls — excluded entirely from WM director rounds, story
rounds, and town scans until downstream backfills `engine.world_worldviews`.

## Current limits

- `world_posts` / `world_post_comments` keep rows indefinitely — no retention,
  unlike `world_memories` (deliberate). The reply-responder scan is bounded by
  an activity window (`reply_window_secs`) plus a partial index, so its cost is
  independent of total post count; a disk-retention knob, if ever wanted, is a
  separate mechanism, not coupled to the sweeper.
- No comment pagination, likes/reactions, images in posts, user-authored
  posts, or notifications — see the specs' out-of-scope lists.
