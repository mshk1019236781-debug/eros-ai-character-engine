# Deploying

[English](deploying.md) · [中文](deploying.zh.md)

Two supported paths, in order of effort:

1. **Docker self-host** — pull the prebuilt GHCR image (or build from `docker/Dockerfile`); single-host VPS brings its own Postgres+pgvector.
2. **Embed as a library** — `core + llm + store` from crates.io into your own service, no HTTP layer.

## Prerequisites in all cases

- Postgres 16+ with the `pgvector` extension (≥ 0.7).
- An OpenRouter account (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`).
- A Voyage AI account (`VOYAGE_API_KEY`) — required unless `[tasks.embedding]` routes both read and write off Voyage (see [Model config](model-config.md)); the default (no `[tasks.embedding]` block) still needs it.
- Either a Supabase project (for default JWT auth) or your own JWT issuer (implement `AuthValidator`).

## Subcommands

The binary has four modes (dispatched by `argv[1]`):

| Subcommand | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `serve` (default) | Run the HTTP server on `BIND_ADDR` |
| `migrate` | Apply pending sqlx migrations and exit |
| `seed-personas [dir]` | Read every `*.toml` in `[dir]` (default `/etc/eros-engine/personas` — the examples baked into the Docker image) and upsert as a persona genome |
| `print-openapi` | Dump the OpenAPI spec to stdout and exit (no DB, no env; used by the CI drift check) |

`seed-personas` is idempotent — re-runs update existing rows in place (matched by `name`), preserving UUIDs and FK references in `persona_instances`.

## Path 1: Docker self-host

Multi-arch (`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`) images of `eros-engine-server` are published to GitHub Container Registry for every `v*` tag (`docker/Dockerfile` builds the same artifact if you'd rather build your own):

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/etherfunlab/eros-engine:latest   # or pin a version tag
```

For a single-VPS deployment that runs Postgres+pgvector next to the engine, a compose file along these lines works (the repo ships no compose file — write your own; adjust ports, volumes, env):

```yaml
# compose.yml (sketch)
services:
  postgres:
    image: pgvector/pgvector:pg16
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      POSTGRES_DB: eros_engine
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U postgres"]
      interval: 2s
    volumes:
      - eros_pg:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  engine:
    image: ghcr.io/etherfunlab/eros-engine:latest  # pin a version tag in production
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: postgres://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/eros_engine
      OPENROUTER_API_KEY: ${OPENROUTER_API_KEY}
      VOYAGE_API_KEY: ${VOYAGE_API_KEY}
      SUPABASE_URL: ${SUPABASE_URL}   # JWKS auth — the post-2025 Supabase default
      # SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET: ${SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET}   # legacy HS256 alternative
    ports: ["8080:8080"]

volumes:
  eros_pg:
```

Nothing migrates automatically — run the `migrate` subcommand before the first `serve` and again after every image upgrade:

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres
docker compose run --rm engine migrate
docker compose run --rm engine seed-personas /etc/eros-engine/personas  # optional: example personas (manual step — upserts by name)
docker compose up -d engine
```

**Upgrading an existing deployment across v1.6.x–v1.7.2?** That range is a four-release chain whose migrations are each safe only against the code one hop earlier — skipping a hop breaks live traffic for the length of the rollout (lost writes on some paths, failed reads on others). Read [migrating/v1-7-2-llm-generations.md](migrating/v1-7-2-llm-generations.md) before jumping versions. (Fresh installs are exempt.)

At least one auth source must be wired — `SUPABASE_URL` (or `SUPABASE_JWKS_URL`) for asymmetric JWKS validation, or a non-empty legacy `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`. With neither, the engine refuses to boot — by design, so a misconfigured deploy fails loudly instead of silently rejecting every request.

**Model config:** the image bakes the sanitized `examples/model_config.toml` at `/etc/eros-engine/model_config.toml` and presets `MODEL_CONFIG_PATH` to it, so the container boots as-is. Note the baked example includes live `[tasks.world_*]` sections — harmless with zero world enrollments (no LLM calls), but the world sweepers do run; set `WORLD_DISABLED=true` if you want the [World system](world-system.md) fully inert.

Conversely, `[tasks.chat_image_prompt_compose]` is commented out in the baked example — and the image-prompt composer is required for image capability, so out of the box image turns stay unavailable and image actions silently degrade to text until you configure that block. See [Model config → image-prompt composer](model-config.md#taskschat_image_prompt_compose--image-prompt-composer-required-for-image-turns).

For a real deployment, mount your own config and point `MODEL_CONFIG_PATH` at it — or set `MODEL_CONFIG_DIR` to a mounted directory of `.toml` fragments merged at boot. The two are mutually exclusive, and the image presets `MODEL_CONFIG_PATH`, so going the directory route means clearing it explicitly (`MODEL_CONFIG_PATH=` — empty counts as unset). See [Model config](model-config.md).

Place a real Caddy / Traefik / Cloudflare in front for HTTPS termination.

## Path 2: Embed as a library

If you don't need the HTTP layer — say you're building a different product on top of the affinity + memory pipeline — skip `eros-engine-server` entirely. The three library crates are published on crates.io:

```toml
[dependencies]
eros-engine-core  = "1.0"
eros-engine-llm   = "1.0"
eros-engine-store = "1.0"
```

(To track unreleased work, use `{ git = "https://github.com/etherfunlab/eros-engine", branch = "main" }` instead.)

Then construct a pool, repos, LLM clients, and write your own dispatch layer:

```rust
let pool = eros_engine_store::pool::build(&database_url).await?;
let openrouter = eros_engine_llm::openrouter::OpenRouterClient::new(or_key);
let voyage = eros_engine_llm::voyage::VoyageClient::new(voyage_key);

let affinity_repo = eros_engine_store::affinity::AffinityRepo { pool: &pool };
let mut affinity = affinity_repo
    .load_or_create(session_id, user_id, instance_id)
    .await?;

let signals = eros_engine_core::ghost::GhostSignals { … };
match eros_engine_core::ghost::decide(&affinity, signals) {
    GhostDecision::Reply  => { /* run chat */ }
    GhostDecision::Ghost => { /* stay silent */ }
}
```

The migration files ship with the `eros-engine-store` crate under `migrations/`; point `sqlx::migrate!("<path>")` at that directory and run it against your pool. The macro needs a compile-time path, so vendor the directory or use a path dependency — the server itself does `sqlx::migrate!("../eros-engine-store/migrations")`.

## Bring-your-own auth

The default JWT validator is Supabase — JWKS asymmetric (ES256/RS256/EdDSA) via `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_JWKS_URL`, with a legacy HS256 shared-secret fallback (`SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`). Plug another IdP by implementing the trait:

```rust
use async_trait::async_trait;
use eros_engine_server::auth::{AuthError, AuthValidator};
use uuid::Uuid;

pub struct MyValidator { /* … */ }

#[async_trait]
impl AuthValidator for MyValidator {
    async fn validate(&self, bearer: &str) -> Result<Uuid, AuthError> {
        // verify your token here, return the user_id
    }
}
```

Then inject your impl into `AppState.auth: Arc<dyn AuthValidator>`. The middleware (`auth::middleware::require_auth`) is generic over whatever validator you provide.

(`eros-engine-server` is intentionally not published as a library, so this is guidance for running a fork of the server. Path 2 embedders skip the HTTP auth layer entirely and enforce their own.)

## Bring-your-own Postgres

Anything compatible with the sqlx Postgres driver works — Supabase, Neon, RDS, Crunchy Bridge, plain self-hosted. Hard requirement: pgvector extension installed (`CREATE EXTENSION vector;`). The engine creates its own schema (`CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS engine;` in migration `0000_schema.sql`) so it coexists cleanly with whatever else is in the database.

If you're sharing a database with another service, the engine's tables stay in `engine.*` and never write to `public.*` — collision-free.

### Supabase deployments — schema-exposure footgun

If your Postgres provider is Supabase **and** you've added `engine` to the project's Exposed Schemas list (Studio → Settings → API → Exposed schemas) so a co-deployed web app can read `engine.*` through `@supabase/supabase-js`, you've also potentially exposed every `engine.*` table to the publishable `anon` key — depending on which roles Studio's Permissions panel granted SELECT/INSERT/etc to.

The hazard: a holder of the publishable anon key (which ships in every browser bundle by design) can issue:

```bash
curl "https://<project>.supabase.co/rest/v1/chat_messages?select=*&limit=5" \
  -H "apikey: <publishable-anon-key>"
```

…and read every user's chat history if `anon` was ever granted SELECT on `engine.chat_messages`.

Migration `0013_supabase_lockdown.sql` (shipped with eros-engine 0.2+) closes this by:

1. `REVOKE ALL` on every `engine.*` table from `anon` and `authenticated`
2. `REVOKE USAGE ON SCHEMA engine` from `anon` and `authenticated`
3. `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` on every `engine.*` table (no policies — defense in depth; the `postgres` owner and `service_role` bypass RLS, which covers the engine binary and any server-side Supabase client)

The migration is guarded by `IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_roles WHERE rolname = 'anon')`, so non-Supabase Postgres deployments (Neon, RDS, plain self-hosted) skip the REVOKEs silently and only inherit the harmless RLS enable.

**If you upgraded from a pre-0.2 release on Supabase, run `eros-engine migrate` once to apply this — it's idempotent.**

To audit your project independently of this migration, run as the `postgres` role:

```sql
-- Which tables in engine.* are missing RLS?
SELECT relname FROM pg_class
 WHERE relnamespace = 'engine'::regnamespace
   AND relkind = 'r' AND NOT relrowsecurity;

-- Which engine.* tables expose anything to anon / authenticated?
SELECT grantee, table_name, privilege_type
  FROM information_schema.role_table_grants
 WHERE table_schema = 'engine'
   AND grantee IN ('anon', 'authenticated');
```

Both queries should return zero rows after the migration applies.

## Operational notes

### Prompt logging (debug, optional)

Set `PROMPT_LOG_DIR` to capture the fully-assembled main-reply prompt for each
turn as one human-readable file (header + per-message blocks). It is **off by
default**, **operator-only** (files contain raw chat content), and writes
fire-and-forget so it never blocks or fails a reply. Point it at a mounted
volume you control:

```yaml
# docker-compose: mount a volume and set the env
services:
  engine:
    environment:
      PROMPT_LOG_DIR: /data/prompt-logs
    volumes:
      - ./prompt-logs:/data/prompt-logs
```

```toml
# fly.io: declare a mount + the env (illustrative)
[mounts]
source = "prompt_logs"
destination = "/data/prompt-logs"

[env]
PROMPT_LOG_DIR = "/data/prompt-logs"
```

There is no built-in rotation or retention — manage the volume yourself.

### World system (experimental, optional)

The [World system](world-system.md) (World Memories simulation + World Town
feed + World Stories per-instance life simulation) is fully off by default:
without a `[tasks.world_director]` model-config section it spawns no sweepers
and runs zero per-turn queries. Turning it on is a config + data decision, not
a deploy change:

1. Add the `[tasks.world_*]` sections to your model config (see
   [`examples/model_config.toml`](../examples/model_config.toml)).
2. Enroll owners by inserting rows into `engine.world_enrollments` over a
   `service_role` / owner connection (the engine only reads this table); set
   `town_enabled = true` per owner to also enable the feed, and
   `stories_enabled = true` to also enable World Stories.

- `engine.world_worldviews` — per-owner worldview text (1..=10000 chars).
  Downstream-written, engine-read. The engine ships no default: enrolled
  owners without a row (or with blank content) get **no** World System LLM
  activity until one is provided. Updating the content resets that owner's
  world on the next tick (published town posts are kept as history).

Operational switches, all optional:

| Variable | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `WORLD_DISABLED=true` | Master off: no sweepers, no prompt injection, zero cost |
| `WORLD_PROMPT_DISABLED=true` | Simulate + accumulate, but don't touch chat prompts (staged-rollout valve) |
| `WORLD_TICK_SECS` | Director sweeper tick (default 300; `0` disables) |
| `WORLD_TOWN_DISABLED=true` | Town only: no post generation, no town sweeper; memories keep running |
| `WORLD_STORIES_DISABLED=true` | Stories only: no life rounds, no `[world_stories]` injection; memories keep running |
| `WORLD_STORIES_PROMPT_DISABLED=true` | Keep simulating lives, but don't touch chat prompts (staged-rollout valve) |

Cost shape: one director call per enrolled owner **with a usable worldview**
per `interval_hours`, plus (town only) activity-gated hourly comment rounds
and per-owner-capped replies, plus (stories only) per-instance life rounds on
their own cadence. Owners without a worldview (see above) are skipped entirely
and cost nothing. A world nobody interacts with costs exactly the director
call. Details, data model, and the boot-validation rules are in
[World system](world-system.md).

- **Env vars:** the complete variable list lives in [`.env.example`](../.env.example); it is deliberately terse — details live in this guide and in [model-config.md](model-config.md).
- **Affinity tuning:** the write pipeline's knobs — `AFFINITY_GRADE_UNIT_BOND`, `AFFINITY_GRADE_UNIT_CHEM`, `AFFINITY_NEG_FACTOR`, `AFFINITY_TIER_DECAY`, `AFFINITY_CROSS_PENALTY_RATIO`, `AFFINITY_CROSS_PENALTY_START`, `AFFINITY_DELTA_THRESHOLD`, `AFFINITY_DEMO_BOOST`, plus the endpoint-derivation trio `AFFINITY_FLOOR_RATIO` / `AFFINITY_TIME_DECAY_RATE` / `AFFINITY_TIME_DECAY_FLOOR` — are all optional and fall back to the 4.0 defaults. See [Affinity model → Write pipeline](affinity-model.md#write-pipeline-affinity-40).
- **Echo cancellation:** each text turn injects a window of the session's recent messages (sized under *Noise cancellation* below), and models repeat themselves — measured across seven production models at 0.57%–15.38% of assistant turns, with no model at zero. A duplicate left in the window raises the probability of another copy, which is then stored and injected again. So within the messages one turn injects, any non-empty string occurring more than once is dropped in all of its occurrences, except the current turn's own user message, which is never dropped. Dropped slots are not backfilled. Comparison is byte-exact and role-blind. `CHAT_ECHO_CANCELLATION_DISABLED=1` opts out; the voice path has its own window and is unaffected. Turns that dropped something log one `INFO` line with counts only — no message content. Design: [echo cancellation](superpowers/specs/2026-08-19-chat-echo-cancellation-design.md).
- **Noise cancellation:** a text turn still fetches the session's last 20 messages, but injects only some of them (at least 3, usually up to 17, and bounded only by the fetch — see below), and strips the leading sentence off every assistant row it injects — that opening sentence carries the style the model copies from itself (`唔` / `啊` / `嗯啊`) and almost none of the information. It also strips parenthesized action blocks (`（凑近）`-style stage directions) from those rows and collapses the whitespace left behind — blocks are self-propagating: what the model sees in its own recent replies it goes on to write more of, and an instruction alone cannot override what the history demonstrates, so the prompt stops showing them; the `[output]` line's annotation ban covers the spontaneous remainder. Stored `content` keeps the original text; only the injected copy is stripped. An assistant row left empty by the strips is dropped rather than sent as empty content, which some providers reject; user rows are never stripped. How many rows are injected is a function of how completely that relationship's `character_insights` row is filled: 7 or more of its ten fields non-empty injects 3 rows in the steady state — the current turn, which is always kept, plus the previous exchange (the previous turn's user message and its assistant reply) — and each field below 7 adds 2 more, up to 14 extra when the row is absent or wholly empty (17 rows in the steady state). The previous exchange is not a flat two-row budget: it's the newest prior user row plus everything between it and the current turn, floored at 2 rows so that two adjacent user rows (a double-text, a ghosted turn, a stripped-empty assistant row dropped upstream) can't evict the character's actual last reply. A turn that left two assistant rows (e.g. a text reply and a separate image row) keeps three prior rows, not two — so the total can run past 17 when a turn's previous exchange is longer than usual, bounded only by how many rows survived the strip. `CHAT_NOISE_CANCELLATION_DISABLED=1` restores the previous shape in full: a fixed 20-row window with assistant rows injected whole, and the `[character_state]` block (see [API reference](api-reference.md#get-v2compinstanceinstance_idinsightcharacter)) omitted from the prompt. Turns where the strip emptied a row or the ladder narrowed the window log one `INFO` line with counts only — no message content. Design: [echo cancellation plus](superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-echo-cancellation-plus-design.md).
- **Background sweepers:** `serve` also runs the dreaming-lite (session-end memory classifier) and insight-snapshot sweepers. Both are optional: `DREAMING_DISABLED=1` / `SNAPSHOT_DISABLED=1` turn them off without affecting the chat path. Dreaming wakes every `DREAMING_TICK_SECS` (default 300) and classifies sessions idle for at least `DREAMING_IDLE_SECS` (default 1800); a classification claim older than `DREAMING_CLAIM_STALE_SECS` (default 600) is treated as a crashed worker and re-claimed. `DREAMING_VOICE_DISABLED=1` narrows the sweeper back to text-only sessions (by default, ended voice calls are distilled into memories too — see [memory-layers.md](memory-layers.md#voice-turns)). The snapshot sweeper runs on a 6-field cron `SNAPSHOT_CRON` (default `0 0 23 * * *`) in `SNAPSHOT_TZ` (default `Asia/Singapore`); an unparseable cron means the sweeper never starts (chat path unaffected), and an unparseable zone falls back to the default.
- **Async chat queue (optional):** `POST /v2/comp/session/{session_id}/message/async` (see [API reference](api-reference.md#post-v2compsessionsession_idmessageasync)) hands a chat turn to a background worker — the fifth boot-time sweeper — instead of streaming it; the reply lands in `engine.chat_messages` for pickup via history or Supabase Realtime. `CHAT_QUEUE_DISABLED=1` stops the worker only, mirroring the other sweepers — enqueues still succeed, they just sit `pending` until re-enabled. (Stream turns still self-drive with the worker off, but the reaper is off too: a crashed stream turn's `claimed` row is never recovered and blocks that session's async turns until the worker is re-enabled.) The worker wakes every `CHAT_QUEUE_TICK_SECS` (default 5, plus an immediate nudge per enqueue) and runs up to `CHAT_QUEUE_CONCURRENCY` (default 4) turns at once; a claim older than `CHAT_QUEUE_GEN_TIMEOUT_SECS` + `CHAT_QUEUE_CLAIM_STALE_SECS` (defaults 300 + 300) is treated as a crashed worker and re-claimed — the stale window is grace *beyond* the generation deadline, so a still-running turn is never reaped mid-drive; a turn gets up to `CHAT_QUEUE_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (default 3) attempts in total before it's marked `failed`; one generation is capped at `CHAT_QUEUE_GEN_TIMEOUT_SECS` (default 300); and `CHAT_QUEUE_PENDING_CAP` (default 20) is the per-session enqueue depth that returns `429 rate_limited`. Zero or negative values for any of these knobs fall back to the defaults — except `CHAT_QUEUE_CONCURRENCY=0`, which is meaningful: the worker claims nothing (reap-only), a second kill switch. Queue order is strict per-session LIFO — the newest message in a session goes first, and nothing is dropped or coalesced. Stream turns ride the same table as born-claimed rows (single attempt, settled by the request's own drive task); the worker only ever touches them if the process died mid-turn and the reaper recovered the row. Design: [async chat endpoint spec](superpowers/specs/2026-08-20-async-chat-endpoint-design.md).
- **OpenRouter attribution (optional):** declare a `headers` table under `[providers.openrouter]` in the model config — `HTTP-Referer` / `X-OpenRouter-Title` / `X-OpenRouter-Categories` — to add attribution headers to every outbound OpenRouter call so the deployment shows up on OpenRouter's app dashboard; leave the entry (or its `headers` key) absent to stay anonymous. See [Model config → Built-in endpoint overrides](model-config.md#built-in-endpoint-overrides-via-providersopenrouter). The old `OPENROUTER_APP_REFERER` / `OPENROUTER_APP_TITLE` / `OPENROUTER_APP_CATEGORIES` env vars are soft-deprecated: still-set values are silently ignored, never a boot error, and `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` has been removed outright — override the endpoint URL via `[providers].openrouter.chat` / `.embeddings` instead.
- **Health probe:** `GET /healthz` returns 200 with `{ status: "ok", service, version, timestamp }`. Wire this into your platform's health check.
- **OpenAPI / Scalar:** `GET /docs` serves a live Scalar reference. The raw OpenAPI JSON is not served over HTTP — dump it with the `print-openapi` subcommand.
- **Affinity for the frontend:** `GET /bff/v1/comp/affinity/{session_id}` returns the absolute vector refreshed at read time, and `.../event` returns the per-turn delta plus the post-turn state. `GET /bff/v1/comp/affinities/{user_id}` is the list form of the first — every companion's refreshed value in one paginated round trip, for a client rendering a conversation list. All three are JWT + ownership checked and always registered — the old `EXPOSE_AFFINITY_DEBUG` gate and the debug routes it hid are gone as of `v1.3.1`. See [migrating/v1-3-1-affinity-4-0.md](migrating/v1-3-1-affinity-4-0.md).
- **Logs:** `RUST_LOG=info` is the default. Set `RUST_LOG=debug,sqlx=warn` to see everything except SQLx query churn.
- **Cost:** the OSS deployment defaults to a fast, cheap model for chat and a capable extraction model for insight extraction (see `examples/model_config.toml` for current defaults). A typical chat turn costs ≪ $0.001 in token spend plus a Voyage embedding call (~$0.000003 for a memory-worthy fact). 10k chat turns costs single-digit dollars.
