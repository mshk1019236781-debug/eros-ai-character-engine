# Prompt traits

A per-request hook for injecting caller-controlled fragments into the
persona system prompt.

## Shape

```jsonc
{
  "content": "...",
  "client_msg_id": "01J3333333333333333333333A",
  "prompt_traits": [
    { "tag": "ascii_identifier", "text": "verbatim text to inject" }
  ]
}
```

Accepted on `POST /comp/chat/{session_id}/message/stream` and on
`POST /v2/comp/session/{session_id}/message/async`, where the traits ride the
queue and are re-validated in the worker.

## What the engine does

For each turn, the validated `text` of every trait is rendered as a
bullet under a `[additional_guidance]` section inside the persona system
prompt, positioned between `[topics]` and `[turn_style]`. Empty list →
the section is omitted and the prompt is byte-for-byte identical to
the legacy output.

## What the engine does NOT do

- **Not persona state.** Traits are never written to the persona/genome
  tables and are never auto-replayed on a later turn — each request must
  re-supply the traits it wants applied. The engine does write an audit
  copy into ordinary chat history: the verbatim `{tag, text}` array lands
  in the user row's `chat_messages.metadata.prompt_traits_raw`, and the
  kept (post-tier-gated) tags land in the assistant row's
  `metadata.prompt_traits`.
- **No content interpretation.** The engine treats `text` as opaque.
  Sanitisation and user-consent gating are the caller's responsibility.
- **No semantic categories.** `tag` is a logging key — the engine does
  not interpret `"nsfw_boost"` differently from `"politics_open"`.
- **Engine-side allow-listing (defense-in-depth only).** The engine now
  drops trait tags that are not in the resolved tier's `allow_traits` list —
  those tags are silently excluded from injection and the reply is still
  generated normally. Caller-side blocking is still recommended as the
  primary guard; engine-side filtering is defense-in-depth.

## Tier gating

Tags outside the request tier's `allow_traits` are not injected into the
system prompt. Specifically:

- Dropped tags are logged (tag name only, never the `text` body).
- The reply is generated normally even if all traits are dropped.
- Configure allow-lists per tier in `model_config.toml`:
  ```toml
  [tasks.chat_companion.tiers.gold]
  allow_traits = ["allow_nsfw", "allow_politics"]
  ```
  Tier blocks are only valid under `chat_companion` and `chat_output_filter`;
  a tier block under any other task refuses to boot (see
  [model-config.md](model-config.md#tier-blocks-are-limited-to-two-tasks)).
- **Three-state semantics:**
  - `allow_traits` absent — no gating; all traits are injected.
  - `allow_traits = []` — drop all traits.
  - `allow_traits = ["a", "b"]` — whitelist; only listed tags are injected.
- The `tier` field on the request selects the tier block (see
  [api-reference.md](api-reference.md#post-compchatsession_idmessagestream)).
  Unknown or absent tier → task default block's `allow_traits`.

## Limits

| Field                 | Limit                              |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| `prompt_traits` count | ≤ 8                                |
| `tag`                 | regex `^[a-z0-9_]{1,32}$`          |
| `text`                | 1 ≤ chars ≤ 2000 (after trim)      |
| `text` content        | no control characters (incl. `\n`) |

Violations return `400 BadRequest` and **no user message row is persisted**.

## Observability

The engine logs an `info`-level event **only when the tier's `allow_traits`
actually drops something** — message `prompt_traits: dropped tags not allowed
for tier`, fields `tier`, `kept` (how many survived), and `dropped_tags` (the
tags that were removed). A turn where every supplied trait is kept logs
nothing. The `text` body is never logged.

API callers without server-log access can see the result on the SSE `final`
frame's `prompt_injected` field — the tags actually injected this turn, after
tier gating. See [api-reference.md](api-reference.md).

## Threat model

A compromised client can attempt prompt-injection through `text`. The
engine now performs server-side tag filtering via `allow_traits` (see
"Tier gating" above), but protecting persona internals is ultimately the
caller's responsibility. Use deployer-side allow-listing of `tag`
values as the primary guard; the engine-side filtering is defense-in-depth.

## Why not persona state?

By design, the engine's persona table is the long-lived contract. Traits
are intentionally kept out of it so caller-side experimentation, A/B
testing, and per-session policy don't pollute persona rows or require
migrations. (The `chat_messages.metadata` audit copy is ordinary chat
history, not persona state — see "What the engine does NOT do" above.)
