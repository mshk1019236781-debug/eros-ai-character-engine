# Migrating through the llm_generations consolidation (v1.6.1 → v1.7.2)

**Applies to:** existing deployments upgrading across any part of the
v1.6.1–v1.7.2 range — the four releases that moved per-generation `model` /
`usage` off eight child tables and into `engine.llm_generations` (store
migrations `0059`, `0060`, `0061`).
**Design:** [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-24-llm-generations-audit-design.md`](../superpowers/specs/2026-08-24-llm-generations-audit-design.md) §7–§8.

**Skipping a hop in this chain breaks live traffic for the length of the
rollout — lost user writes on some paths, failed reads on every turn on
others.** Each migration in it is safe only against the code that shipped one
hop earlier, because `fly.toml` (and any deployment copying its shape) runs
`migrate` as a `release_command` — the schema changes **before** traffic
moves, so for the length of every rollout the *previous* build serves against
the *new* schema.

**Fresh installs are exempt.** On an empty database the migrations apply in
order, the backfill selects zero rows, the FKs validate trivially, and `0061`
drops columns nothing ever wrote — no old code is serving. The four-release
split is a rolling-upgrade requirement, not a database requirement. If you are
installing v1.7.2+ from scratch, stop reading; this guide is for deployments
with traffic.

---

## 1. The chain

| hop | release | contents | migration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | v1.6.1 (or v1.6.2) | every LLM call site writes a parent row to `engine.llm_generations` | `0059` (creates the table) |
| B1 | v1.7.0 | backfill, eight indexes, eight **validated** foreign keys; code stops **writing** child `model` / `usage` | `0060` |
| B2-code | v1.7.1 | code stops **reading** them: `ChatMessage` loses the fields, replay joins `llm_generations` | none |
| B2-drop | v1.7.2 | `DROP` `model` / `usage` from the eight child tables | `0061` |

Each hop must be deployed **and serving** before the next hop's migration
runs. "Tagged" is not "serving", and neither is "the image is on the
machines" — `release_command` completes before traffic moves.

## 2. Preconditions, and how to verify each one

**Before deploying v1.7.0** (running `0060`): the serving build must be
Release A or later — a build that writes parent rows. Verify from the
database, not from tags:

```sql
SELECT count(*) > 0
FROM engine.llm_generations
WHERE created_at > now() - interval '1 hour';
```

A recent row is the only evidence the build *currently taking traffic* writes
parents — checking the tag proves nothing (v1.6.1 was tagged while production
still ran v1.6.0), and checking the image is not enough either (the image can
be right on machines that have not taken traffic yet). The caveat: the query
returns false on a freshly provisioned or idle instance even when the build
is right. On a quiet instance, **generate the evidence**: send one real chat
turn, then re-run the query — one recent parent row is what a truthful answer
looks like.

**Before deploying v1.7.2** (running `0061`): every serving machine must be on
v1.7.1 or later — the build that neither writes nor reads the columns. The
evidence here is an *absence*, so no query can prove it. Check
`fly image show -a <app>` (or your platform's equivalent) reports v1.7.1+ on
**every** machine, with none mid-rollout. If you run a patched or forked
build, additionally verify the store crate has no INSERT naming `model` /
`usage` on the eight tables and no `FromRow` struct hydrating those columns —
stock v1.7.1+ satisfies both by construction.

**v1.7.1 itself has no precondition** beyond following v1.7.0: it carries no
migration and is valid on both sides of `0061` — being deployable on either
side is the reason the hop exists.

## 3. What each skip actually does

All three failure windows run from the moment the migration commits until
traffic has finished moving to the new build.

**≤ v1.6.0 → v1.7.2+ in one deploy** (one `release_command` applies
`0059`+`0060`+`0061` while a pre-A build serves):

1. The moment `0060` commits, its eight foreign keys are live. The serving
   build does not write parent rows, so every child INSERT violates a
   constraint — for `chat_messages`, that is a user's reply failing to
   persist.
2. After `0061`, the serving build's child INSERTs name `model` / `usage` —
   columns that no longer exist.
3. The same build hydrates `ChatMessage` via `SELECT *`, so every history
   read raises `ColumnNotFound` — every turn that loads context.

`0060` may instead **abort**, and that is the good outcome: its backfill and
orphan preflight take separate snapshots under READ COMMITTED, so a child row
the still-serving build commits between them is an orphan the preflight
raises on. The `release_command` fails and the old machines keep serving —
`0059` has already committed as its own migration, but it is additive and
harmless to the old build, and the foreign keys never landed. But this abort
is timing-dependent, not a version gate — a low-traffic instance will likely
sail through and then take 1–3.

**v1.6.1 / v1.6.2 → v1.7.2+** (skipping B1 and B2-code): 1 does not apply —
Release A writes parents — but 2 and 3 both do. This is the likeliest mistake
in practice, because v1.6.2 looks recent and skipping two hops looks like
saving two deploys. (v1.6.0 is *not* in this class: it predates Release A and
takes the full path above.)

**v1.7.0 → v1.7.2+** (skipping B2-code): only 3 applies, and it is the worst
of the three — not just replays but every turn that loads context fails for
the length of the rollout.

## 4. The rollback floor

Once `0061` has run, the oldest build that can serve is **v1.7.1**. v1.7.0
reads the dropped columns through `SELECT *` hydration; Release A and v1.6.2
additionally name them in every child INSERT. A deployer who skipped up and
hits trouble has no way back, only forward.

Between `0060` and `0061`, the floor is v1.6.1: `0060`'s foreign keys
require a build that writes parent rows. Before `0060`, the chain imposes no
floor.

## 5. Behaviors of `0060` and `0061` worth knowing before you run them

- Both set `SET LOCAL lock_timeout = '3s'` (`0061`'s `DROP COLUMN` takes
  ACCESS EXCLUSIVE, so the same reasoning carries over). If a long-running
  transaction holds a lock either needs, the migration **fails fast** rather
  than holding `chat_messages` write-blocked behind the wait — a failed
  `release_command` leaves the old machines serving. Re-run the deploy.
- `chat_messages.filter_model` survives `0061` on purpose. It is a
  discriminator that happens to be spelled like a model name (the regex arm
  writes a `<regex>` sentinel with no generation id at all), not a redundant
  copy of the parent's `model`.

## 6. Checklist

- [ ] Decide which hop you are on. `SELECT version FROM _sqlx_migrations
      ORDER BY version DESC LIMIT 1` tells you the schema; your serving image
      tells you the code. You need both.
- [ ] Walk the chain in order — v1.6.1 (or v1.6.2), then v1.7.0, then
      v1.7.1, then v1.7.2 — deploying each hop and confirming it is
      **serving** before the next.
- [ ] Before v1.7.0: run the §2 one-query check; on a quiet instance, send
      one real turn first to generate the evidence.
- [ ] Before v1.7.2: verify **every** machine serves v1.7.1+, none
      mid-rollout.
- [ ] If `0060` or `0061` aborts on a `lock_timeout` — or `0060` on its
      orphan preflight — nothing is broken: the old build is still serving.
      Fix the precondition (or just re-run, for a lock trip) and deploy
      again.
- [ ] After v1.7.2: treat v1.7.1 as the rollback floor. Do not roll back
      further for any reason; roll forward instead.
